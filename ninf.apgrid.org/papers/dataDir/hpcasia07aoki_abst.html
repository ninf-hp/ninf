Past work on “programming for the grid” for compute-
intensive applications have largely focused on two ex-
tremes, either loosely-coupled, cycle-scavenging, desktop
grid environments such as BOINC or Condor vs. tightly-
coupled metacomputing systems such as MPICH-G2 or
GridMPI. Neither is really appropriate for class of ap-
plications that are middle-tier, e.g., fine-grained branch-
and-bound master-worker applications where the run-
ning time of individual jobs may range from less than
tenth of a second to few minutes, and communication in-
tervals being further fine-grained.Our new grid program-
mingmiddleware and framework, Jojo2, allows efficient
programming of fine-grained, hierarchicalmaster-worker
applications on a grid-of-clusters environment. During
programming, much of the complexities associated with
hierarchy and changes in the underlying resources are
hidden away or isolated, and the user need not be aware of
physical configuration of the resources. Even during exe-
cution, new compute resources can be explicitly be added
via batch submissions, and are subsequently automati-
cally detected and incorporated in the system. Evaluation
of Jojo2 on real master-worker applications proved very
positive, both on TSUBAME, a supercomputing cluster
with 10,000 nodes, as well as a nationwide testbed in-
volving more than 800 CPUs and a number of 100-node
class clusters. In both cases, applications on Jojo2 not
only scaled very well, but autonomously adapted to bulk
changes in the order of hundreds of underlying resources,
both resources being added as well as those going away.
