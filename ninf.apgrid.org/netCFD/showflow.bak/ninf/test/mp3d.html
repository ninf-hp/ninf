<h1>MP3D: a Demonstration of Ninf </h1>

This program shows  3d particle flow simulation.<br>
Each dot represents one particle.<br>
The applet connects with a Ninf Server on ninf.etl.go.jp.<br>
A Routine on the server callbacks to display the figure.<br>
Note that NinfCall is performed just one time.<br>
