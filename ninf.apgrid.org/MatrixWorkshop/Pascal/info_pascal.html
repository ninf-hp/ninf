	Let A = a[i][j] be the n*n matrix defined by

		a[1][j] = a[j][1] = k != 0 ,   j = 1,2,...,n,
					       (!= is not =.)
		a[i][j] = a[i-1][j]+a[i][j-1], i,j = 2,3,...,n.

	Equivalently, we have, for i,j = 1,2,...,n,

		a[i][j] = k*(i+j-2)! / ( (i-1)! * (j-1)! ).

	This is called Pascal's matrix because the coefficients of
        k are obtained from the Psacal triangle of binomial coefficients.
	If k is the reciprocal of an integer, the elements of A**-1 are integers. 
        In addition, det(A) = k**n.

	For example, when n = 4 and k = 1/7,
	            -                   -
                    | 1/7 1/7  1/7  1/7 |
	 	A = | 1/7 2/7  3/7  4/7 | 
                    | 1/7 3/7  6/7 10/7 |
                    | 1/7 4/7 10/7 20/7 |
	            -                   - 
                    -                -
                    |  28 -42  28 -7 |
            A**-1 = | -42  98 -77 21 |
                    |  28  98 -77 21 |
                    |  -7  21 -21  7 |
                    -                -

		det(A) = 1/(7**4) = 1/2401.
