Omni remote procedure call facility, OmniRPC, is a thread-
safe grid RPC facility for cluster and global computing environments.
The remote libraries are implemented as executable programs in each
remote computer, and OmniRPC automatically allocates remote library
calls dynamically on appropriate remote computers to facilitate location
transparency. We propose to use OpenMP as an easy-to-use and simple
programming environment for the multi-threaded client of OmniRPC.
We use the POSIX thread implementation of the Omni OpenMP com-
piler which allows multi-threaded execution of OpenMP programs by
POSIX threads even in a single processor. Multiple outstanding requests
of OmniRPC calls in OpenMP work-sharing construct are dispatched to
diferent remote computers to exploit network-wide parallelizm.
