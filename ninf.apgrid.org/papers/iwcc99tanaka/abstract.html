<hr>
In this paper, we present a new type of Globus resource allocation
manager (GRAM) called RMF (Resource Manager beyond the Firewall) for
wide-area cluster computing.  RMF manages computing resources such as
cluster systems and enables utilization of them beyond the firewall in
global computing environments.  RMF consists of two basic modules, a
remote job queuing system (Q system) and a resource allocator.  The Q
system is a remote job queuing system, which schedules jobs submitted
from global computing sites.  The resource allocator manages resources
and allocates them for requested jobs.  For communications beyond the
firewall between job processes, we designed the Nexus Proxy, which
relays TCP communication links beyond the firewall.  RMF and the Nexus
Proxy provide a global computing environment in which users can easily
utilize such parallel systems as cluster systems and supercomputers
beyond the firewall.
