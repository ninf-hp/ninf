<h1> Ninf Client Package </h1>

<hr>


<h1> Description </h1>
This package provides
<ul>
<li> libraries for ninf client programs.
<li> include files for Your Makefile.
<li> some test programs.
</ul>

This package currently supports six architectures.
<ul>
<li> solaris : Solaris 2.2 or later.
<li> sunos:    Solaris 1.1.3 or later
<li> linux:    linux on x86
<li> j90:      Cray super computer J90 and C90
<li> alpha:    OSF for DEC Alpha
<li> AIX:      AIX
</ul>
However, our programs are written in a portable way,
so it will be very easy to port them.

<h1> Ninf Usage </h1>
</center>

<h2> 1. Make Ninf Package  </h2>
First of all, uncompress and untar the package.
In the top directory of this package, type:

<pre>
   >./MAKE ARCHITECTURE_TYPE 
</pre>

ARCHITECTURE_TYPE must be one of the following architectures:
sunos, solaris, j90, linux, alpha and AIX.

The MAKE script makes a directory with the architecture name,
and links source files in the directory,
and then executes 'make'.

This script will make two directories, 'lib' and 'include'.
You can install them by typing,
<pre>
    >(cd ARCHITECTURE_TYPE; ./MAKE install-client)
</pre>

If you want to make Ninf for different architecture,
simply try <tt>./MAKE ANOTHER_ARCHITECTURE_TYPE</tt>. 

To clean up the diretory, type
<pre>
    >./MAKE clean ARCHITECTURE_TYPE
</pre>


<h2> 2. How to 'Make' Ninf Client Programs </h2>

<h3> 2.1 Set environment variable 'NINF_DIR' </h3>
Set NINF_DIR environment variable to point to the
'ninfClient/ARCHITECTURE_TYPE' directory or installed directory.
For example, if you installed the ninf client package to the
/usr/local/ninf/ directory, 
<pre>
  setenv NINF_DIR /usr/local/ninf
</pre>


<h3> 2.2 Write your Makefile  </h3>
Write the following line on top of your Makefile.
<pre>
include $(NINF_DIR)/template
</pre>

The 'template' file provides macros 'NINF_CFLAGS' and 'NINF_LDFLAGS'.
These are needed to link Ninf Libraries.

Typical rule for ninf client program  is like this.
<pre>
test: test.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(NINF_CFLAGS) -o test test.c $(LDFLAGS) $(NINF_LDFLAGS)
</pre>

In clientTest/ directory , there are some sample programs which 
can make access our server at ETL, Japan,  directly.
