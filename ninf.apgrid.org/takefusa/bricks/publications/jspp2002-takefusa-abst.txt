DataGrid is a Grid environment for petascale data-intensive
computing. Being in the development stage, performance of DataGrid
systems on large-scale and realistic applications have not been
well-investigated. Using the Bricks Grid simulator, we investigate the
performance of various DataGrid system models in simulation by
assuming actual application scenarios.
