Grid and Network provisioning technology has enabled the construction of high-quality virtual computing infrastructures spanning several administrative organizations. However, it is still difficult for users to monitor the usage of distributed and various resources managed by multiple domains. We propose an authorization-based hierarchical distributed resource monitoring system called DMS that gathers information based on resource reservation, and filters information with the policies specified by the administrators using XACML, which is a standard authorization model and a policy description language. DMS co-works with the GridARS co-allocation framework to retrieve resource reservation information and adopts web services technologies and an extension of a standard data representation set. To confirm feasibility of the DMS system, we describe monitoring strategies for reserved computing and network resources in Collectors and we have developed a WSRF-based DMS prototype, which enables authorization by XACML. The experiments using the prototype system show: (1) Even when DMS employs a large number of policies, the overhead of the XACML authorization decision process is negligible, since that of WSRF/GSI is more dominant in the total processing time, and (2) the benefits of parallel information aggregation from multiple domains make the retrieval latency acceptable.
