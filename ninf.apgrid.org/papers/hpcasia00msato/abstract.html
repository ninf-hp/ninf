Ninf is a middleware for building a global computing system in wide
area network environments. We designed and implemented a Ninf
computational component, netCFD for CFD (Computational Fluid
Dynamics). The Ninf Remote Procedure Call (RPC) provides an interface
to a parallel CFD program running on any high performance
platforms. The netCFD turns high performance platforms such as
supercomputers and clusters into valuable components for use in global
computing. Our experiment shows that the overhead of a remote netCFD
computation for a typical application was about 10\% comparing with
its conventional local execution. The netCFD applet GUI which is
loaded in a web browser allows a remote user to control and visualize
the CFD computation results interactively.
