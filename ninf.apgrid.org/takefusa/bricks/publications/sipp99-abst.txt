While there have been several proposals of high performance global
computing systems, scheduling schemes for the systems have not
been well investigated.  The reason is difficulties of evaluation by
large-scale benchmarks with reproducible results. 
This paper describes design and implementation of the simulator that
evaluates scheduling schemes on a typical high-performance global
computing system. 
The simulator can simulate various features of global computing
systems by adopting a queueing model. 
Effectiveness of the simulator was verified by the simulation results,
which showed very similar results to the experimental results on a real
global computing system. 
This paper also shows simulation results of simple scheduling schemes
by the simulator.
Results show it is important to consider resource conditions
appropriately for overall system performance.
