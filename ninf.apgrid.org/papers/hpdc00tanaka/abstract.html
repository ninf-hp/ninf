In this paper, we present a performance evaluation of a wide-area
cluster system based on a firewall-enabled Globus metacomputing
toolkit.  In order to establish communication links beyond the
firewall, we have designed and implemented a resource manager called
RMF (Resource Manager beyond the Firewall) and the Nexus Proxy, which
relays TCP communication links beyond the firewall.  In order to
extend the Globus Metacomputing Toolkit to the firewall-enabled
toolkit, we have built the Nexus Proxy into the Globus toolkit.  We
have built a firewall-enabled Globus-based wide-area cluster system in
Japan and run some benchmarks on it.  In this paper, we report various
performance results such as the communication bandwidth and latencies
obtained as well as application performance involving a tree search
problem.  In a wide-area environment, the communication latency
through the Nexus Proxy is approximately six times larger when
compared to that of direct communications.  As message size increases
however, the communication overhead caused by the Nexus Proxy can be
negligible.  We have developed a tree search problem using MPICH-G.
We used a self-scheduling algorithm, which is considered to be
suitable for a distributed heterogeneous metacomputing environment
since it performs dynamic load balancing with low overhead.  The
performance results indicate that the communication overhead caused by
the Nexus Proxy is not a severe problem in metacomputing environments.
