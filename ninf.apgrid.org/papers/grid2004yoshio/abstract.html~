GridRPC, which is an RPC mechanism tailored for the Grid, is an
attractive programming model for Grid computing.  This paper reports
on the design and implementation of a GridRPC programming system called
Ninf-G.  Ninf-G is a reference implementation of the GridRPC API
which has been proposed for standardization at the Global Grid Forum.  In
this paper, we describe the design, implementations and typical usage
of Ninf-G.  A preliminary performance evaluation in both WAN and LAN
environments is also reported.  Implemented on top of the Globus
Toolkit, Ninf-G provides a simple and easy programming interface based
on standard Grid protocols and the API for Grid Computing.  The overhead
of remote procedure calls in Ninf-G is acceptable in both WAN and LAN
environments.
