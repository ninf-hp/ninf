<h2> The Administrator's Manual</h2>

This section describes the way to create and manage Ninf-G
libraries.

<h3><a name="manage">Managing the Ninf-G remote libraries </a> </h3>

Before starting, be sure that the environment variables
<i>GLOBUS_LOCATION</i> (for GT2) or <i>GLOBUS_INSTALL_PATH</i> (for Globus Ver.1),
and <i>NS_DIR</i> are defined appropriately.

The Ninf-G system has no server component in charge of dispatching an
appropriate numerical library to the client unlike the original Ninf system. As
described in the previous section, the Globus JobManager on the host
which the Ninf-G remote libraries are installed spawns off a numerical library. 
Consequently, it is not required to start or stop the Ninf-G server component
explicity as long as Globus is available.

Be sure that the Globus gatekeeper and GRIS/GIIS are appropriately running and available
on the host.
