<h1> Abstract </h1>

<hr>
As the Grid proliferates as the next-generation computing
infrastructure, a user interface in the form of "Grid Portals" is
becoming increasingly important, especially for computational
scientists and engineers. Although several Grid Portal toolkits have
been proposed, the portal developer still must build and deploy both
the user interface and the application, which results in considerable
programming efforts. We aim to ease this burden by generating the
portal frontend (that constitutes of JSP and Java Servlets) from an XML
document for the former, and a GridRPC system, Ninf-G for easily
"gridifying" existing applications for the latter, and realizing their
seamless integration. The resulting system, which we call the Ninf
Portal, allowed concise description and easy deployment of a real Grid
application with greatly small programming efforts.
