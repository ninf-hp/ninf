For high performance parallel computing on actual Grids, one of the important issues is to co-allocate the distributed resources that are managed by various local schedulers with advance reservation. To address the issue, we proposed and developed the GridARS resource co-allocation framework, and a general advance reservation protocol that uses WSRF/GSI and a two-phased commit (2PC) protocol to enable a generic and secure advance reservation process based on distributed transactions, and provides the interface module for various existing resource schedulers. To confirm the effectiveness of GridARS, we describe the performance of a simultaneous reservation process and a case study of GridARS grid co-allocation over transpacific computing and network resources. Our experiments showed that: 1) the GridARS simultaneous 2PC reservation process is scalable and practical and 2) GridARS can co-allocate distributed resources managed by various local schedulers stably.
