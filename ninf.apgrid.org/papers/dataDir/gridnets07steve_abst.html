This paper describes innovative architectures and techniques for reserving and coordinating highly distributed resources, a capability required for many large scale applications. In the fall of 2006, Japan's G-lambda research team and the United States' EnLIGHTened Computing research team used these innovations to achieve the world's first inter-domain coordination of resource managers for in-advance reservation of network bandwidth and compute resources between and among both the US and Japan. The compute and network resource managers had different interfaces and were independently developed. Automated interoperability among the resources in both countries was enabled through various Grid middleware components. In this paper, we describe the middleware components, testbeds, results, and lessons learned.
