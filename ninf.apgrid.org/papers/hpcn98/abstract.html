<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
Rapid increase in speed and availability of global-network is
opening up the possibilities of globally-distributed supercomputing,
including our <i><b> Ninf</b></i> system. 
<p>
Ninf is designed to utilize existing numerical libraries and resources
on the Web.  It also has global scheduling server called the Ninf 
<b><i>Metaserver</b></i>,
 which is responsible for scheduling and load-distribution
of parallel tasks.  The metaserver keeps track of computational
servers, and gathers information needed for scheduling.  Using the
information, it balances loads over computational servers.
<p>
We performed preliminary benchmarks using the metaserver.
There, we observed that scheduling cost can be ignored and dynamic 
scheduling by the server gained better score than static-cyclic distribution.
<p>
 We also report on our collaborative efforts in bridging Ninf with
<i>NetSolve</i>, a similar system being developed at Univ. of Tennessee/ORNL.
