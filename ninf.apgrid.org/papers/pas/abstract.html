<hr>
The world-wide computing infrastructure on the growing
computer network technology is a leading technology to
make a variety of information services accessible
through the Internet for every users from the high-end
high performance computing users through many of
personal computing users.  The important feature of
such services is location transparency; information can
be obtained irrespective of time or location in
virtually shared manner.  In this article, we introduce
Ninf, an ongoing global network-wide computing
infrastructure project which allows users to access
computational resources including hardware, software
and scientific data distributed across a wide area
network.  Preliminary performance result on measuring
software and network overhead is shown that promises
the future reality of world-wide network computing.
