# With the introduction of a configurable index page using the
# template toolkit, Bugzilla's main index page is now index.cgi.
# Most web servers will allow you to use index.cgi as a directory
# index and many come preconfigured that way, however if yours
# doesn't you'll need an index.html file that provides redirection
# to index.cgi. Setting $index_html to 1 below will allow
# checksetup.pl to create one for you if it doesn't exist.
# NOTE: checksetup.pl will not replace an existing file, so if you
#       wish to have checksetup.pl create one for you, you must
#       make sure that there isn't already an index.html
$index_html = 0;


#
# In order to do certain functions in Bugzilla (such as sync the shadow
# database), we require the MySQL Binaries (mysql, mysqldump, and mysqladmin).
# Because it's possible that these files aren't in your path, you can specify
# their location here.
# Please specify only the directory name, with no trailing slash.
$mysqlpath = "/usr/local/mysql/bin";


#
# If you are using Apache for your web server, Bugzilla can create .htaccess
# files for you that will instruct Apache not to serve files that shouldn't
# be accessed from the web (like your local configuration data and non-cgi
# executable files).  For this to work, the directory your Bugzilla
# installation is in must be within the jurisdiction of a <Directory> block
# in the httpd.conf file that has 'AllowOverride Limit' in it.  If it has
# 'AllowOverride All' or other options with Limit, that's fine.
# (Older Apache installations may use an access.conf file to store these
# <Directory> blocks.)
# If this is set to 1, Bugzilla will create these files if they don't exist.
# If this is set to 0, Bugzilla will not create these files.

# This is the group your web server runs on.

# If you do not have access to the group your web server runs under,
# set this to "". If you do set this to "", then your Bugzilla installation
# will be _VERY_ insecure, because some files will be world readable/writable,
# and so anyone who can get local access to your machine can do whatever they
# want. You should only have this set to "" if this is a testing installation
# and you cannot set this up any other way. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
# If you set this to anything besides "", you will need to run checksetup.pl
# as root, or as a user who is a member of the specified group.

# need to escape it by preceding it with a \ character. (\') or (\\)
