NOTE (6/15/97): These guidelines have been updated for the final, accepted
paper submission process. All final papers must be received by August 15,
1997.

The following guidelines describe the requirements for submitting a
technical paper for Supercomputing '97 including specific details on the
appropriate use of HTML tags. The organizers and the publisher will be
working under tight time constraints during both the review and publication
process. Please follow the instructions carefully to ensure inclusion of
your paper in the proceedings. If you have problems complying with the
instructions, send e-mail to proceedings97@mail.supercomp.org.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Requirements

     The proceedings will be published on the conference web server
     (http://www.supercomp.org) and on CD-ROM. The web proceedings will
     be made public two weeks in advance of the beginning of the
     conference. The CD-ROM will be available at the beginning of the
     conference.

     Paper size is limited to 5000 words or less. This is equivalent to
     25 double-spaced pages.

     Final papers should be submitted in the following two formats:

        * HTML
        * postscript

     It is important that submitted papers follow the guidelines as
     closely as possible. Neither the editors nor the publishers can
     retype or significantly modify contributions before publication.

     Authors will be required to submit a hardcopy signed ACM Copyright
     Form for all papers accepted for publication. This form will be
     sent to the contact for each paper and will be available
     electronically.

File Naming Convention

     In order to build a cross-platform CD-ROM it is necessary that all
     files conform to the ISO 9660 file system and naming conventions.
     This is IMPORTANT: The following rules must be followed:

        * Filenames must conform to the DOS file naming convention of 8
          characters followed by a three character extension
          (nmnmnmnm.eee).
        * Filenames can include ONLY the following characters:
             o Uppercase letters and numbers
             o Underscores (_)
             o No more that one period (.)
        * Directory structure must be less than 7 levels deep

     The following specific naming conventions should be used for
     components of your paper:

                     Type of File     3 Character Extension
                 HTML source          .HTM
                 GIF images           .GIF
                 JPEG images          .JPG
                 MPEG animations      .MPG
                 Quicktime animations .MOV
                 Audio                .AU, .AIF, or .WAV
                 RealAudio            .RAM
                 PostScript           .PS

     Your main text file should be called INDEX.HTM and follow the
     template provided (see html coding rules).

HTML Coding Rules

General Coding

     Submitted papers should be written in syntactically correct HTML
     2.0. HTML 3.2 tags, including table support and alignment
     instructions, may also be used. HTML tags which are Netscape
     extensions should not be used. An excellent reference source for
     HTML tags is the The Bare Bones Guide To HTML by Kevin Werbach.

     The entire text of the paper should be included in a single,
     linear HTML file named INDEX.HTM that is structured after the
     template for INDEX.HTM provided. The only exception to this might
     be large illustrations or "active parts" as described below. While
     HTML hyperlinks allow creation of multiple navigation paths
     through the information in the document, these can be confusing
     and make printing difficult. The model which is being used for
     constructing the proceedings is still the hardcopy paper. HTML
     links should be largely limited to incorporation of multimedia
     components.

              author biographies | instructions for latex users
       postscript file | submission of paper | electronic cover sheet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Template for INDEX.HTM

     The template for INDEX.HTM specifies the position and relative
     pathnames for navigational buttons that will be used in the
     proceedings, as well as the background color, an example of how to
     insert a figure and a table, and the default font size for titles,
     text and captions. The navigational panel in the template is for
     use in INDEX.HTM only.

     To obtain the template:

        * view it
        * download the file TEMPLATE.HTM in source format to your
          system.
        * set up a directory/folder named GIF97 at the same level as
          your working directory/folder (to preserve the relative
          pathnames used in TEMPLATE.HTM). Please DO NOT use GIF97 for
          the figures in your paper, it is used ONLY for these SC97
          buttons, banners and other provided GIF files.
        * download the following five buttons into GIF97 and preserve
          their names: BTOC97.GIF, BTAUTH.GIF, BTSESS.GIF, BTABST.GIF,
          BPS.GIF.

       postscript file | submission of paper | electronic cover sheet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Equations

     Equations keyed in LaTeX are preferred. The equations have to be
     clearly legible on a UNIX workstation. All subscripts,
     superscripts and other small sized annotations have to be
     readable. If latex2html is used, the $MATH_SCALE_FACTOR should be
     set to 1.6 in the initialization file, this file is usually called
     '.latex2html-init'.

     Manuscripts developed using software like WordPerfect or Word
     programs are acceptable, but the mathematics may be rekeyed into a
     LaTeX format for the production of the proceedings. Equations that
     are typeset by a page layout software (Ventura, Quark, Pagemaker,
     FrameMaker) may be rekeyed as well.

     As a rule of thumb, the font size in the equation should match the
     default html font for the text, <BASEFONT SIZE=4>, as specified in
     the template for INDEX.HTM.

     The following is an example of the font size required for
     equations, so that subscripts are of acceptable size. Please note
     that in-line mathematical expressions may also be coded in HTML,
     in which case they will scale with the text, the example given
     here is for equations provided in form of an image file.

     To approximate   , we divide....

     AND:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figures and tables

     Figures or illustrations should be included as in-lined images.
     GIF or JPEG (8-bit color only) are acceptable formats. The maximum
     horizontal size should be limited to 500 pixels. Figures of large
     size may be linked as external images with a small or lower
     resolution anchor within the text.

     Captions for figures and tables should be coded as in this example
     or any other way that displays in a comparable font size.

            Table 1: This is a sample caption with the following
             HTML coding: <FONT SIZE=+0.5><B>(text)</B></FONT>

     NOTE: It is preferable to keep captions that accompany images
     separate from the image to allow for font changes during
     processing.

     All annotations in figures have to be readable on a screen. For
     examples of figures from the SC96 proceedings that display well
     click here.

     For tables the proposed HTML 3.0 table tags (see example below)
     are recommended. Alternatively, use the preformat tags (<PRE> ...
     </PRE>) or in-lined images. All text in tables needs to be
     readable, in particular those tables included as in-lined images.
     Choose the largest possible font size without exceeding the
     default font size of the paper.

     The example below shows HTML 3.0 coding for a table. Authors
     should use the following border size and cellpadding for
     consistency:

     <CENTER>
     <TABLE BORDER=5 CELLPADDING=5>

     <TR>
     <TD>N</TD>
     <TD>spdup</TD>

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     Links

          We distinguish three types of links:

             * internal links (pointing to a place in the same
               text file): to use as pointers to footnotes and
               your reference list at the end of the article.
               Limit other uses.
             * local links (on the same server): for figures,
               tables, images, 'active' parts and SC97 Proceedings
               navaigation buttons. All local links should be
               defined relative to the referring document.
             * external links (to outside servers): restrict the
               use of external links to matters that are not vital
               to the contents of the paper. Any external
               materials linked to your paper should have a long
               expected lifetime at the current address.

       postscript file | submission of paper | electronic cover sheet

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     Multimedia components

          Publication in HTML allows for nontraditional components
          such as animations or interactive demonstrations to be
          included. These "active parts" in your paper should be
          treated as an illustration to the main text and be
          delivered in a separate file under a local link. Links
          to your own Web server should be avoided if possible. If
          you have special circumstances where extensive external
          links will be required this should be discussed with the
          proceedings publication team.

          When including simple in-lined images or multimedia
          components into your document be sure that all links are
          relative and that the components are inluded with the
          submitted paper.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     Footnotes and References

     Footnotes:

          Use the HTML 3.0 standard tags for superscripts
          (<SUP></SUP>) for footnotes with an internal link to the
          list of footnotes. The list of footnotes should appear
          at the end of the paper, but before the reference list,
          in INDEX.HTM. For example:

          The first footnote in the text of the paper<A
          HREF="#f1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>.

          The second footnote in the text of the paper<A
          HREF="#f2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>.

          <HR>
          <H2>Footnotes</H2>
          &#160;<A NAME="f1"><SUP>1</SUP></A>Footnote 1 here.<P>
          &#160;<A NAME="f2"><SUP>2</SUP></A>Footnote 2 here.<P>
          If your paper is generated via a translator such as
          latex2html, then the footnotes may be left in the format
          produced by the translator.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     References:

          References within the paper should include an internal
          link to the reference list at the end of the paper. For
          example:

          In the text, the first reference is coded as follows
          <A HREF="#r1">[1]</A>.

          And the second reference, similarly, is coded
          <A HREF="#r2">[2]</A>.

          In the reference section at the end of the paper the
          definition list construct (<DL><DT></DL>) should be
          used, unless the references were generated with
          latex2html, in which case the references may be left in
          the format generated by the translator.

     Author Biographies

          A section titled "Author Biographies" may provide a
          quarter- to half-page biographical sketch as appropriate
          for each author. The biographical sketches should be at
          the end of the paper with an internal link from the
          author's name, where it is listed at the beginning of
          the paper (see the template for INDEX.HTM). In addition
          to the usual biographical information, a biographical
          sketch may include a small picture (an inline GIF or
          JPEG image), a URL if the author has a home page, and a
          mailto link for the e-mail address (see the template for
          INDEX.HTM).

     Instructions for LaTeX users

          Authors using LaTeX for the preparation of their paper
          should submit the LaTeX file and any style files used in
          addition to the html and ps files. The top of the LaTeX
          file should contain information on which version of
          LaTeX, latex2html and dvips (dvi2ps) have been used to
          obtain the submitted html and ps files.

          References and footnotes may be left in the format
          generated by latex2html. Figure and table captions need
          to be adjusted to the proper font size as described in
          the section on "Figures and Tables" in these guidelines.

          Authors should concatenate the set of .HTM files
          typically generated by latex2html into one file named
          INDEX.HTM as discussed in the section on "HTML Coding
          Rules". If the paper is submitted with a set of .HTM
          files, then the top-level file should be named
          INDEX.HTM. This file should be edited to follow the
          template provided in these guidelines. (See "HTML Coding
          Rules" for how to obtain the template and associated
          navigational images.)

     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     PostScript File

          The PostScript version should be a single file and
          functionally identical to the HTML version. All
          graphical parts should be included in the PostScript
          file. 'Active Parts' in your HTML version should be
          described in an appendix to your paper. For papers
          contained in a single file with only in-lined images,
          the PostScript version can be created choosing the
          "print to disk" or "save as" option in your web browser.
          In development of the proceedings, the PostScript
          version will be used for verification of the HTML
          version. The PostScript version will also appear in the
          final proceedings as an alternative method of viewing
          and printing.

          Detailed instructions for PostScript papers follow. If
          you generate the postscript version of your paper
          through a Web browser you may ignore the font size and
          type requirements.

             * Font: Times-Roman -- Since it is often difficult to
               read italicized fonts on a low-resolution monitor,
               we ask that you not use italicized text anywhere in
               your paper (except as required in mathematical
               expressions). Please substitute bold text for
               italic.
             * Math fonts: If you use a special math font, please
               include the font in the PostScript file. Please
               also include the font name, type, and vendor
               information in your cover sheet.
             * Text point size: 12 pt
             * Columns: One (1) column only
             * Spacing: Single Spacing
             * Page Size: 8.5 x 11 inches (42.5x55 cm)
             * Header font: Times-Roman Bold
             * Header point sizes: Level 1 - 18 pt Level 2 - 15 pt
               Level 3 - 12 pt (will generally be rare)
             * Use "Title Case", initial upper and lower case, for
               all headers
             * Images: All images and equations should be included
               in the PostScript version of the paper.
             * Page numbers: centered

Submission of Paper (for the accepted papers stage)

     Submission of your final paper is a two step process. For each
     step you will need your original userid and password. If you have
     forgotten these send email to submissions97@mail.supercomp.org.

     You should first return to the web submission form
     (http://www.supercomp.org/cgi-bin/sc97/submissions) and update the
     information listed there including the abstract. It is from this
     source that the materials in the final program and proceedings
     index will be generated. This step can be done at any time up to
     the submissions deadline.

     The second step is to use the upload utility
     (http://www.supercomp.org/cgi-bin/sc97/upload) to submit the HTML
     and PostScript versions of your paper.Your submission must be a
     single file. If you upload a second file it will overwrite the
     first submission. Multiple files may be packed into a single file
     using the tar utility and compression can be done using one of the
     standard formats listed below.

     Please use only the following forms of data compression/archival:

        * UNIX "tar" (.tar filename extension)
        * UNIX "compress" (.Z filename extension)
        * GNU "gzip" (.gz filename extension)

     Versions of these programs are available for the Microsoft
     Windows, Apple MacOS, and UNIX platforms. Please click here for
     help on locating versions of these tools for your platform. If you
     absolutely cannot use these tools on your workstation, please send
     e-mail to proceedings97@mail.supercomp.org and we will make
