<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
Recent developments of global computing systems such as Ninf, NetSolve
and Globus have opened up the opportunites for providing
high-performance computing services over wide-area networks. However,
most research focused on the individual architectural aspects
of the system, or application deployment examples, instead of the
necessary charactersistics such systems should intrinsically satisfy,
nor how such systems relate with each other.  Our comparative
study performs deployment of example applications of network-based
libraries using Ninf, NetSolve, and CORBA systems. There, we discover that
dedicated systems for global computing such as Ninf and NetSolve have
management, progammability, and in does not suffer performance disadvantages
over more generic distributed computing capabilities provided by CORBA. 
Such results indicate the advantage of dedicated global computing systems
over general systems, stemming further basic research is necessary
across multiple systems to identify the ideal software architectures 
for global computing.
