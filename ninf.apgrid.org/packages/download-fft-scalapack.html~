<div class="abstract">
FFTW2-G is a library that provides an interface between FFTW (only
version 2.x) and Ninf-G.

FFTW is a library for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
in one or more dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of
arbitrary input size. The library is available at the FFTW home page
(http://www.fftw.org). 
<br>
ScaLAPACK-G is a library that provides an interface between ScaLAPACK
and Ninf-G.  ScaLAPACK is a library of a collection of linear algebra
for parallel computing. It's freely available on netlib
(http://www.netlib.org ).

ScaLAPACK-G is not only a collection of interfaces of ScaLAPACK
functions for GridRPC, but also a collection of wrappers giving
LAPACK-like arguments by which you can use ScaLAPACK without any
feeling of using parallel functions.

By using ScaLAPACK-G, you can execute ScaLAPACK functions on a remote
parallel computing system as if they were LAPACK functions run
locally.
