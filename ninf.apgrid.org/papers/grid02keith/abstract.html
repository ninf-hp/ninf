<hr>
This paper discusses preliminary work on standardizing and
implementing a remote procedure calll (RPC) mechanism for grid
computing.  The GridRPC API is designed to address the lack of a
standardized, portable, and simple programming interface.  Our initial
work on GridRPC shows that client access to existing grid computing
systems such as NetSolve and Ninf can be unified via a common API, a
task that has proven to be problematic in the past.
