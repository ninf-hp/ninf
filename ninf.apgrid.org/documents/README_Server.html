<h1> Ninf Server Package </h1>	
</center>
<hr>

<h1> Description </h1>
This package provides
<ul>
<li> The ninf server 'ninf_serv_tcp'.
<li> Stub generator 'ninf_gen'.
<li> 'ninf_register' which register executables to the server.
<li> Libraries for ninf client programs.
<li> Libraries for ninf executables.
<li> Include files for Your Makefile.
</ul>

This package supports following architectures.
<ul>
<li> solaris : Solaris 2.2 or later.
<li> sunos:    Solaris 1.1.3 or later
<li> linux:    linux on x86
<li> j90:      Cray super computer J90 or C90
<li> alpha:    OSF for DEC Alpha
</ul>
However, our programs are written in a portable way,
so it will be very easy to port them.

<h1> Ninf Usage </h1>
</center>

<h2> 1. Make Ninf Package  </h2>
First of all, uncompress and untar the package.
The package will give a top directory called "server".
Go to the directory and type:

<pre>
   >./MAKE ARCHITECTURE_TYPE 
</pre>

ARCHITECTURE_TYPE must be one of the following architectures:
sunos, solaris, j90, linux, alpha.

The MAKE script makes a directory with the architecture name,
and links source files in the directory,
and then executes 'make'.

This script will make three directories, 'bin', 'lib' and 'include'.
You can install them by typing,
<pre>
    >./MAKE install INSTALL_DIR
</pre>

If you want to make Ninf for different architecture,
first, install Ninf in the other directory,
secondly, clean up this directory by typing,
<pre>
    >./MAKE clean
</pre>
thirdly, make Ninf again for another architecture.

<h2> 2. How to 'Make' Ninf Client Programs </h2>

<h3> 2.1 Set environment variable 'NINF_DIR' </h3>
Set NINF_DIR environment variable to point to the architecture directory.
For example, if you untared the package /usr/local/ninf and your architecture
is 'solaris', you should set NINF_DIR to point to /usr/local/ninf/server/solaris,
like this.

<pre>
  setenv NINF_DIR /usr/local/ninf
</pre>

NOTE: If you installed them to the other directory, 
of course you should specify the directory.

<h3> 2.2 Write your Makefile  </h3>
Write the following line on top of your Makefile.
<pre>
include $(NINF_DIR)/libtemplate
</pre>

The 'template' file provides macros 'NINF_CFLAGS' and 'NINF_LDFLAGS'.
These are needed to link Ninf Libraries.

Typical rule for ninf client program  is like this.
<pre>
test: test.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(NINF_CFLAGS) -o test test.c $(LDFLAGS) $(NINF_LDFLAGS)
</pre>


<h2> 3. How to make Ninf Executable </h2>
<h3> 3.1 Set environment variable </h3>
As same as 2.1, set the variable.

<h3> 3.2 Write your Makefile  </h3>
As same as 2.2, include the template file.
<pre>
include $(NINF_DIR)/lib/template
</pre>

Then, you can use NINF_GEN macro.
This macro gives you a program which produce makefile and stub programs.

For example, your IDL file is 'ep.idl' and
your routine is provided by 'ep_slave.o', 
then Makefile should contain following lines.

<pre>
ep.mak: ep.idl
	$(NINF_GEN) $<

_stub_ep: ep_slave.o ep.mak
	make -f ep.mak
</pre>
