<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
While advance reservation is an essential capability for co-allocating several resources on Grid environments, it is not obvious how it can co-exist with priority-based First Come First Served scheduling, that is widely used as local scheduling policy today. To investigate this problem, we 1) developed a scheduling API in Java for TORQUE, a variant of OpenPBS, that enables users to implement their own schedulers and replace the original scheduling module with them, 2) implemented a prototype scheduler module that has advance reservation capability with the API. We also provide an external interface for the reservation capability based on WSRF to enable co-allocation of resources over the Grid. Using this interface with the job submission module from Globus toolkit 4, users can make reservation for resources and submit jobs over the Grid.
