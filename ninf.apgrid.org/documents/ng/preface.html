<h1>Ninf-G Manual</h1>
<p>

This document is intended to provide the reader with a discussion of
how to use the different components of the Ninf-G system and to serve
as a reference manual for the commands and functions made available by
Ninf-G. Although we offer a brief discussion of the Ninf-G System,
this document is not necessarily intended to provide details about the
Ninf-G components. The reader should refer to the <i> Documentation
</i> section of the Ninf-G homepage (<a
href="http://ninf.apgrid.org/"> http://ninf.apgrid.org/</a>) for more
appropriate discussion of the Ninf-G system. The reader is expected to
have some level of familiarity with programming and at least one
programming languages, preferably the C language. Rudimentary
knowledge of the UNIX operating system environment, the <b> make </b>
utility, and the Globus toolkit will prove handy if installing and
configuring Ninf-G for the UNIX environment.
