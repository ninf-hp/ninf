While there have been several proposals of high performance global
computing systems, job scheduling schemes for the systems have not
been well investigated.  The reason is difficulties of evaluation by
large-scale benchmarks with reproducible results. This paper describes
design and implementation of the simulator that evaluates job
scheduling schemes on the high-performance global computing
system. The simulator can simulate various features on global
computing systems by adopting queueing model. Effectiveness of the
simulator was verified by the simulation results, which showed same
results as experimental results on a real global computing
system. This paper also shows simulation results of simple job
scheduling schemes by the simulator.
