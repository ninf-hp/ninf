<h2><a name="known_problems">10. Known problems </a></h2>

<p>This section describes known problems in
Ninf-G version 2.4.0.</p>

<hr>
<ol>

<li><strong>heartbeat detection by Ninf-G client is
not supported for non-thread flavor.</strong>

<p>Heartbeat detection by Ninf-G client is not supported for non-thread
flavor.  In order to detect the heartbeat from Ninf-G Executables, use
pthread flavor for Ninf-G client.</p>

<p>Note: Sending heartbeat by Ninf-G Executables is supported for
both pthread and non-thread flavors.</p>
<br>

<li><strong>Refresh credentials and Session timeout feature is
not supported for non-thread flavor.</strong>

<p>The Refresh credentials
(in &lt;CLIENT&gt; section in client configuration file)
 and Session timeout (RPC timeout)
(in &lt;FUNCTION_INFO&gt; section in client configuration file)
feature in Ninf-G Client is not supported for non-thread flavor.</p>

<li><strong>dcomplex type is not available
with gcc-2.96 on IA64 platform.</strong>

<p>dcomplex variables is not available if gcc-2.96 is used on IA64
platform.<br>
Although compilation of Ninf-G client program will be succeed, the Ninf-G
client program will be terminated with an error.<br>
In order to avoid this problem, other version of gcc should be used.</p>

<li><strong>backend=MPI may cause error between different
versions of Ninf-G</strong>

<p>  Using different versions of Ninf-G on a client and servers may cause
  an error if MPI is used as backend of a remote executable.<br>
  It is recommended to use the same version of Ninf-G on a client and
  servers.
</p>

<li><strong>Java Client sometimes fails when running large-scale
applications on Windows.</strong>

<p>On Windows, ServerSocket sometimes fails to accept requests
for connection from Ninf-G Executables
if it receives many (about 10 or more) requests at the same time.<br>
This should be an Windows-specific problem since it does not appear on
Linux or Solaris.<br>
Use Linux or Solaris for large-scale applications.</p>

<li><strong>"TCP connect retry" function is not supported
by Ninf-G 2.3.0 and prior versions.</strong>

<p>Ninf-G 2.4.0 provides a new capability to retry to establish a TCP
connection between the Ninf-G Executable and the Ninf-G Client if
the Ninf-G Executable fails to connect to the Ninf-G Client.</p>

<p>This is a new capability which is not supported by Ninf-G 2.3.0 and
prior versions.  Although this capability will be provided in the
future release of Ninf-G, be sure that it will cause a problem if
the version of Ninf-G on the client is 2.4.0 or later and the
version of Ninf-G on the server is 2.3.0 or prior.</p>

<p>This problem can be avoided by setting tcp_connect_retryCount to 0
on the &lt;SERVER&gt; section of client configuration file.</p>

<li><strong>Ninf-G Client freezes if an unknown host is specified
as a server.</strong>

<p>Ninf-G Client freezes if it tries to create a function/object
handle for an unknown host whose hostname can not be resolved.
This problem is caused by the bug of the Globus Toolkit version 2
library compiled with pthread flavor.  The library compiled with
non thread flavor does not cause this problem and the bug was
fixed for the Globus Toolkit version 3 or later.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed on Globus Toolkit version 3.2 or
later.</p>

<li><strong>Encryption may cause freezes with GT3 Non Thread flavor.</strong>

<p>
Encryption may cause freezes with GT3 (Globus Toolkit version 3) Non Thread
flavor though encryption works fine with GT3 Pthread flavor.
</p>

<li><strong>Assembler may detect warnings when optimization is enabled.</strong>

<p>
Assembler may detect warnings when optimization is enabled with GCC version
3.2.2 or prior on Itanium2.
<br>
The warning message is as follows:
<pre>
    cc -Wall -O2 <snip> -c -o ngclSession.o ngclSession.c
    /tmp/ccMDS56n.s: Assembler messages:
    /tmp/ccMDS56n.s:10125: Warning: Use of 'mov' may violate WAW dependency 'GR%, %in 1 - 127' (impliedf), specific resource number is 14

</pre>
This problem is reported to GCC bugzilla.
<br>
(http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7908)
<br>
This problem has been fixed on GCC version later than 3.2.2.
</p>

<li><strong>Ninf-G Executable may not be died if MPI is specified as backend.</strong>

<p>
When a Ninf-G Client is terminated by SIGTERM or SIGINT, Ninf-G Executable may
not be died if MPI is specified as backend.
<br>
If you want to use MPI and terminate a Ninf-G Client by SIGTERM or SIGINT,
please use Non Thread flavor at remote side. However, Ninf-G Executable may
not be died until a remote function is completed.
</p>

<li><strong> The hostname attributes in &lt;CLIENT&gt; section 
in the client configuration file may not be set appropriately.</strong>

<p>
The hostname attribute in &lt;CLIENT&gt; section in the client
configuration file may not be set appropriately if
globus_libc_gethostname() is called before grpc_initialize().
</p>

<li><strong>Job start timeout feature is not completely supported for
non-thread flavor.</strong>

<p>
Job start timeout feature (in &lt;SERVER&gt; section in Client configuration
file and handle attributes) does not work with non-thread flavor
in the following case.
<ul>
<li>The first RPC after initializing the function handle is called
    with setting argument_transfer attribute or session attribute to
    copy or nowait.
</ul>
</p>

</ol>
