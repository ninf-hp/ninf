Ninf-G is a Grid RPC system built on top of Globus Tookit.
Ninf-G uses MDS for information sharing, GRAM for server-side executable
invocation and Globus I/O for client-server communication. 
Basic client API is same as current version of Ninf.
<a href=papers/misc/ninf-g.ppt>Here</a> is overview of Ninf-G.
A detailed paper(sorry, it is in Japanese) is available 
<a href=papers/papers.j.shtml#swopp01tanaka>here</a>.
The first beta version of Ninf-G will be published by the end of 2001.

<h2> <a href="http://ninf.is.titech.ac.jp/bricks">Bricks Simulator</a></h2>
While there have been several proposals of high performance global
computing systems, scheduling schemes for the systems have not been
well investigated. The reason is difficulties of evaluation by
large-scale benchmarks with reproducible results. Our Bricks
performance evaluation system would allow analysis and comparison of
various scheduling schemes on a typical high-performance global
computing setting. Bricks can simulate various behaviors of global
computing systems, especially the behavior of networks and resource
scheduling algorithms. Moreover, Bricks is componentalized such that
not only its constituents could be replaced to simulate various
different system algorithms, but also allows incorporation of existing
global computing components via its foreign interface.

<h2>Ninflet</h2>
<p> 
NinfLet is a java based distributed computing framework.
Users can send their programs and execute it on servers provided by volunteer.

<h2><a href="http://ninf.apgrid.org/~ymatsuba/MatrixWorkshop/">MatrixWorkshop</a></h2>
<p>
Our MatrixWorkshop provides matrices in various sizes and characteristics for test and evaluation 
of numerical libraries.
This project is ongoing under the collaboration with 
<a href="http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket">MatrixMarket</a> Project by NIST, US.

<h2><a href="ninf-netsolve.html">Collaboration with NetSolve</a></h2>
<p>
Ninf and <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~casanova/NetSolve/">NetSolve</a> are remote computing systems 
which are oriented to provide numerical computations.
These two systems are very similar to each other 
in there design and motivation.
We made adapters to enable each system to 
use numerical routines installed on the other system.
We will show the design and implementation of the adapters.

<h2>Direct access to Web servers </h2>
<p>
On the Web, various useful data are published.
For example, <a href="http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/">Matrix Market</a>
and our <a href="http://ninf.apgrid.org/~ymatsuba/MatrixWorkshop/">Matrix Workshop </a>
provide matrices for testing various mathematical routines.
Direct use of these published data allows easy evaluation of numerical 
routines.
</p>
<p>
Ninf computational server provides direct Web access facility, by which
users can specify data on Web as arguments for mathematical libraries 
registered with Ninf.
Stub library which is linked with numerical routine
and form the executable file on the server,
has http client facility, enables
application user to use any data on the Web directly.
</p><p>
In addition to the GET command, Ninf client library can also use the
HTTP PUT command to upload computed data to the Web server.
Especially in the case the web server and the Ninf server reside on 
the same machine,
using PUT command will drastically reduce the communication time.

<h2><a href="NinfCalc+/NinfCalcApplet.html">NinfCalc+</a></h2>
 <p>
<a href="NinfCalc+/NinfCalcApplet.html">NinfCalc+</a> 
is a stack-based matrix calculator.
It is implemented using Ninf HTTP access facility, and
handles matrices on http server.
It does not have any facility to store matrices in itself, and always 
uses Web server as a storage.
Hence it performs calculation control only, it does not require 
broad band-width between Ninf server and itself.
It can control huge matrix calculation interactively even from your home 
via phone line.

<h2>Ninf 2</h2>
 <p>
We are designing a new version of Ninf.
It's based on http and pull based data communication, 
to work well with existing data resources such as WWW.<br>

It will be implemented in C++.
