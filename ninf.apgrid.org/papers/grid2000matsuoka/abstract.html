Network Enabled Server is considered to be a good candidate as a
viable Grid middleware, offering an easy-to-use programming model.
This paper clarifies design issues of Network Enabled Server systems
and discusses possible choices, and their implications, namely those
concerning connection methodology, protocol command representation,
security methods, etc.  Based on the issues, we have designed and
implemented new Ninf system v.2.0. For each design decision we
describe the rationale and the details of the implementation as
dictated by the choices. We hope that the paper serves as a design
guideline for future NES systems for the Grid.
