Ninf-G Version 4.2.3 (Ninf-G4) is a bug fixed version of Ninf-G
Version 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, which enable remote proces invocation via WS GRAM,
Pre-WS GRAM, and other Grid middleware such as UNICORE.  Like Ninf-G
4.2.1 and 4.2.2, Ninf-G 4.2.3 provides C and Java implementation of
the GridRPC API, a proposed recommendation at the GGF.<br>

Ninf-G 4.2.3 is supposed to be the final version of Ninf-G Version 4.
Ninf-G 4.2.3 has some new features and changes which are described in
CHANGES file.  Ninf-G 4.2.3 has also fixed some bugs most of which are
in Invoke Server NAREGISS.  Ninf-G applications are guaranteed
compabitility between Ninf-G 4.2.3 and past versions of Ninf-G4.

<div class="section">About this patch</div>
<div class="section_contents">
Ninf-G 4.2.2 has a problem in building Invoke Server Condor due to
inconsistency of the version of Java SDK.  Ninf-G 4.2.1 was
implemented with Java 1.5, however Ninf-G 4.2.2 was modified to be
built with Java 1.4 to adapt to NAREGI Software environment.  This
change has caused a problem in building Invoke Server Condor in Ninf-G
4.2.2.  As a temporal solution, this patch can be used to build Invoke
Server Condor in Ninf-G 4.2.2.
<br>
Instructions for applying patch are as follows (instructions are included in the patch file itself).
<pre>
    % cd ng-4.2.2/utility/invoke_server/condor/org/apgrid/grpc/tools/invokeServer/condor
    % patch -p0 < /path/to/ng-4.2.2_invoke-server-condor.diff

<div class="section">About Ninf-G 4.2.2</div>

<div class="section_contents">
Ninf-G Version 4.2.2 is released for NAREGI users.  Ninf-G 4.2.2
officially supports NAREGI Super Scheduler for remote process
invocation, i.e. Ninf-G 4.2.2 enables RPC via NAREGISS.<br>
Users, who will NOT use NAREGI SS, are recommended to use Ninf-G
4.2.1.
<br>
Ninf-G 4.2.2 has fixed two new bugs though they are not fatal bugs.
The details of the fixed bugs are described in CHANGES.
<br>
You should be noted that due to the software requirements by NAREGI
SS, Ninf-G 4.2.2 is built with Java 1.4 though Ninf-G 4.2.1 is built
with Java 1.5.  This change has caused a problem on building Invoke
Server Condor in Ninf-G 4.2.2

<div class="section_contents">
Ninf-G Version 4.2.1 (Ninf-G4) is a bug fixed version of Ninf-G
Version 4.2.0, which enables remote proces invocation via WS GRAM,
Pre-WS GRAM, and other Grid middleware such as UNICORE.  Like Ninf-G
4.1.0, Ninf-G 4.2.1 provides C and Java implementation of the GridRPC
API, a proposed recommendation at the GGF.<br>

Ninf-G 4.2.1 has fixed a bug by which the object file of an Ninf-G
Executable (_stub_*.o) is corrupted if it is compiled using mpicc in
MPICH-1.  All Ninf-G users, especially users who use MPICH-1 as
backend of an Ninf-G Executable, are recommended to use Ninf-G 4.2.1.

Ninf-G 4.2.1 has inherited all capabilities of Ninf-G 4.2.0 such as
three Invoke Servers, SSH, Condor, and NAREGI Super Scheduler
(NAREGISS), and cascading RPC, i.e. Ninf-G Executable is able to call
subordinate RPCs.  Other new features and bug fixes are described in
CHANGES file.  Ninf-G applications are guaranteed compabitility
between Ninf-G 4.2.1 and past versions of Ninf-G4.
