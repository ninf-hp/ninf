<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a generic grid interface for Condor. Though Condor has intefaces for specific grid systems, such as Globus Toolkit 2 GRAM, it is not easy to add new interfaces for other grid systems,  since it requires some code modification inside the Condor. With our new interface design, supporting a new grid system can be established without any code modification in the Condor core itself. We also implemented a bridge for the UNICORE system and validated that our approach is effective.
