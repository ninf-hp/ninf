<h1> Abstract </h1>

As grid middleware stacks mature, the importance of
inter-operation among them is getting more significant.
There is a community group called GIN (Grid Interoperation
Now) in the OGF (Open Grid Forum), a standardization
body for grid related technologies, which aims to
establish interoperation among several grid middlewares.
We performed experiments on inter-operation between our
NAREGI Middleware beta and EGEE gLite, as a contribution
to the group. For the experiments, we implemented several
modules to allow information exchange and mutual job
submissions. As the results of the experiment, we confirmed
the followings: 1) The security layer, such as certificates
and virtual organization management, imposes no fundamental
difficulties despite the subtle diffrences in the use of
proxy certificates, 2) While information services differs substantially,
the resource information can be translated to allow
effective information exchange via schema translation
between GLUE and CIM, 3) Jobs can be mutually submitted
based on the exchanged information, despite the differences
in job description languages and interfaces (JSDL vs.
JDL).
