<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
We describe here a GridRPC programming system implemented on top of
the Globus Toolkit, called {\b Ninf-G}.  GridRPC systems enable easy
implementation of parallel application on the Grid by providing simple
programming RPC-style, task-parallel, and largely Grid-transparent
interfaces, and serve as a middleware that glues together Grid
applications and the lower-level Grid substrates such as Globus.  We
overview the GridRPC model of Grid programming, and its implementation
with Ninf-G, including the client side API and the server side IDL, as
well as its typical usage for Grid programming.  We perform
preliminary evaluation in both WAN and LAN environment, demonstrating
that the overhead of Ninf-G is reasonable after the first-time
overhead of GSI authentication is tolerated.
