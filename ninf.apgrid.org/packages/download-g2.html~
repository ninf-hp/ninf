<div class="abstract">
Ninf-G version 2 (Ninf-G2) is the supporting software for the development and execution of programs with the Grid Remote Procedure Call (GridRPC).  Ninf-G2 is a full implementation of the GridRPC API, a proposed GGF standard.  In addition to the GridRPC API, Ninf-G2 provides Ninf-G API for supporting 1) high performance on a large-scale computational Grid, 2) rich functionalities which are required to compensate for the heterogeneity and unreliability of a Grid environment, and 3) easy development and execution of Grid applications.<br>
<br>
Details are described in <a href="../documents/ng2-manual/overview.html">Overview section</a> in the <a href="../documents/ng2-manual/user-manual.html">Ninf-G version 2 users' manual</a>.  Installation instruction is described in the <a href="../documents/ng2-manual/install.html">Installation section</a> in the manual.
<br>
Ninf-G Version 2.4.0 is the latest version of Ninf-G2 and it is expected to be the final release of Ninf-G2.  This release includes the following new features and bug fixes:

<ul>
  <li> <font color="darkslateblue">New features</font> <br>
    <ul>
    <li> Thread-ID is put into log, when loglevel is set to 5(Debug).
    <li> Ninf-G Executable retries to establish a connection to the Ninf-G client when the Ninf-G Executable could not connect to the Ninf-G client.
    <li> The timeout value of a sessions can be specified by a session attribute.
    <li> stdout and stderr of Ninf-G Executable can be put into files.
    <li> "broadcast" and "allocate" modifier are added to Ninf-G IDL for MPI.
      <ul>
      <li> "broadcast" : broadcast the variable to all nodes
      <li> "allocate"  : allocate memory area for the variable on all nodes, but the value is not copied.
      </ul>
    <li> ng_gen accepts CPP options.
    <li> The compression for filename type variables is supported.
    <li> Ninf-G client can re-read the client configuration file on-the-fly.  An API for re-read the client configuration file is added (grpc_config_file_read_np()).
    <li> Ninf-G client can exit without waiting JOB_DONE message from the Globus jobmanager.
    <li> Information of compression is added to grpc_session_info_t_np.
    <li> Arguments and results can be divided into blocks when they are transferred between Ninf-G client and Ninf-G Executable.
    <li> A tutorial document and sample programs are added into tutorial directory.
    </ul>

  <li> <font color="darkslateblue">Changes</font> <br>
    <ul>
    <li> The default value of loglevel was changed from 0 (None) to 2 (Error).
    <li> More detailed messages are put into log of Ninf-G Executable
    <li> The performance of sending/receiving data has been improved
    <li> Filename type variables are transferred without using GASS.
    <li> Implementation of grpc_probe_or() was changed to be compliant with the GridRPC API specification.
    <li> Ninf-G system checks the result field in the protocol data.
    <li> Ninf-G Executable does not catch SIGFEP, SIGSEGV, SIGILL and SIGQUIT.
    <li> log_filePath can take the following keywords:
      <ul>
      <li> %t: the time of creation of the file (yyyymmdd-hhmmss-MMM)
      <li> %p: process-ID
      <li> %h: hostname
      </ul>
    <li> changed the name of API for getting information of the last session (grpc_get_last_error_np() -> grpc_last_error_get_np())
    </ul>

  <li> <font color="darkslateblue">Fixed BUGs</font> <br>
    <ul>
    <li> job_startTimeout is ignored when transfer_argument is set to "nowait".
    <li> ninfg-user-env.sh script removes ${NG_PATH}* from $PATH.
    <li> *_handle_is_ready() freezes when non-thread Ninf-G Client get information of Remote Class from Ninf-G Executable
    <li> Ninf-G Executable failes in making a log directory when multiple Ninf-G Executables are invoked at the same time.
    <li> Ninf-G Executable does not return an error immediately when it fails in making a directory for logfiles.
    <li> Ninf-G client aborted when negative variable is set as job_startTimeout
    <li> save_sessionInfo did't accept "-1" and "0".
    <li> Ninf-G callback which has only OUT mode arguments causes an error.
    <li> Ninf-G callback with no arguments causes an error.
    <li> pthread Ninf-G Client sometimes freezes when it waits the completion of a session.
    <br>
    <li> Remote Function with no arguments cannot be called by "Calls".
    <li> ng_gen can not process a big IDL file whose size is more than 4K Bytes.
    <li> ng_gen overwrites the file which is specified as the 2nd argument.
    <li> ng_gen detects an error if the callback type variable with no arguments is specified as the last argument of a Remote Function.
    <br>
    <li> Java client cannot invoke Ninf-G Executable without LocalLDIF files.
    <li> Java client cannot process Ninf-G Expression which has more than 30 terms.
    <li> Java client occasionally returns incorrect results.
    <br>
    <li> Shrink does not work correctly.
    <li> Invalid parameter of shrink causes an abort.
    <br>
    <li> The number of MPI processes cannot be specified by a handle attribute of an object handle.
    <li> handle_attr_get() causes Segmentation Fault for an initialized handle attribute.
    </ul>
</ul>
