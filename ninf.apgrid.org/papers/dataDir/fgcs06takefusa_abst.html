<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
At iGrid2005, we conducted a live demonstration where our Grid scheduling system co-allocated computing and network resources with advance reservation through Web services interfaces using the Grid Resource Scheduler (GRS), the Network Resource Management System (NRM), which is capable of GMPLS network resource management, and a GMPLS-based network test-bed, for the first time. The goal of the G-lambda project is to define a standard Web services interface (GNS-WSI) between GRS and NRM that is acceptable for both application service providers and commercial network operators, and which can be used as a tool for realizing new and emerging commercial services.
