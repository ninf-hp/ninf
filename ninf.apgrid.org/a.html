SC2001/SCinet contacts for Asia Pacific Grid ,

  This email is a summary of the connections which you have requested from
  SCinet.  It is primarily intended as a reference as you arrive at the show
  and configure your network.

  SCinet has the following connections listed for your booth, R665:

    C Type            Subnet             PTP Link           Router
    - --------------- ------------------ ------------------ ------
    B GigE SX (MM)    140.221.192.0/27   n/a                SCinet

    C Router Address     Netmask            DHCP First      DHCP Last      
    - ------------------ ------------------ --------------- ---------------
    B 140.221.192.30     255.255.255.224    140.221.192.16  140.221.192.29 


  If you are running your own router and have PTP /30, you will use the higher
  address of the /30 for your end.  SCinet will use the lower address of the /30.


  SCinet is operating a show wide DHCP server this year.  The upper half of 
  each alloacted subnet is by default configured to be handed out via DHCP. 
  The range of addresses is reflected above in the DHCP First and DHCP Last
  fields.  If you would prefer not to have DHCP enabled for your network either
  send us email at registration@scinet.supercomp.org or stop by the SCinet
  helpdesk in booth 655.

  The SCinet DNS servers are:

    ns0.scinet.sc2001.org  140.221.130.1
    ns1.scinet.sc2001.org  140.221.130.129

  SCinet is providing a free 802.11b wireless network this year.  If you have
  an 802.11b compliant wireless card simply set your Network Name (SSID) to 
  "scinet" to use wireless anywhere throughout the convention center.  You will
  need to use DHCP to obtain an IP address on the wirelss network.  As a 
  reminder, exhibitors are prohibited from using their own 802.11b wireless 
  access points or using any other devices which may cause interference in the   
  2.4GHz band.  SCinet reserves the right to shut down any device that is 
  interfering with the wireless network.

  Futher information, including up to the minute statistics, trouble tickets,
  network diagrams, etc, will be available on the show webserver:

    http://scinet.sc2001.org/

  If you have problems or questions please send mail to
  scinet@scinet.supercomp.org.

  See you on the showfloor!
