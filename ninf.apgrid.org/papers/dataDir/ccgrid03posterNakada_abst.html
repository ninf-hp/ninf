It is suitable for a grid environment consists of cluster of clusters. Jojo provides several features, including secure remote invocation using Globus GRAM, intuitive message passing API suitable for parallel execution and automatic user program staging. Jojo helps users to construct their own parallel-distributed application on the Grid. In the poster, we show design and implementation of Jojo, its programming API and a working program example. We also show preliminary performance evaluation result.
