Advance Reservation is one possible way to enable resource co-allocation on the Grid. This method requires all the resources to have advance reservation capability as well as coordination protocol support. We employed 2-phased commit protocol as a coordination protocol, which is common in the distributed transaction area, and implemented an Advance Reservation Manager called {\bf PluS}. PluS works with existing local queuing managers, such as TORQUE or Grid Engine, and provides users advance reservation capability. To provide the capability, there are two implementation methods; 1) completely replaces the scheduling module of the queuing manger, 2) represents reservation as a queue and controls the queues using external interface. We designed and implemented a reservation manager with both way, and evaluated them. We found that the former has smaller overhead and allows arbitrary scheduling policy, while the latter is much easier to implement withacceptable response time.
