This paper proposes a performance evaluation model for
effective job scheduling in global computing systems.  The
proposed model represents a global computing system by a
queueing network, in which servers and networks are
represented by queueing systems. Evaluation of the proposed
model showed that the model could simulate behavior of an
actual global computing system and job scheduling on the
system effectively.
