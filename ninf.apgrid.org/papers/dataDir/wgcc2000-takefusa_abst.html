Recent developments of global computing systems such as Ninf, NetSolve, and Globus have opened up the opportunites for providing high-performance computing services over wide-area networks. However, most research focused on the individual architectural aspects of the system, or application deployment examples, instead of critical issues regarding system performance characteristics in global computing. Further, no step-by-step analysis or impartial comparison of various scheduling schemes has been conducted, though the performance and feasibility of a global computing system, which employs a large number of computational resources, highly depends on its scheduling scheme. Evaluation is made difficult by large-scale benchmarks and the need for reproducible results. Our comparative study performs deployment of example applications of network-based libraries using Ninf, NetSolve, and CORBA systems. There, we discover that dedicated systems for global computing such as Ninf and NetSolve have in some cases performance advantages over more generic distributed computing capabilities provided by CORBA. Also, we proposed the Bricks performance evaluation system, which would allow analysis and comparison of various scheduling schemes on a typical high-performance global computing setting. Bricks can simulate various behaviors of global computing systems, especially the behavior of networks and resource scheduling algorithms. Moreover, Bricks is componentalized such that not only its constituents could be replaced to simulate various different system algorithms, but also allows incorporation of existing global computing components via its foreign interface. To test the validity of the latter characteristics, we incorporated the NWS system, which monitors and forecasts global computing systems behavior.
