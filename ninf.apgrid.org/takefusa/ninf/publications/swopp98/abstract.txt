Rapid progress in networking technology is now making global computing
systems feasible. Although there have been proposals of global
computing systems, it is still a research issue as to how to achieve
efficient usage of computing resources in global computing. In
particular, we need to devise appropriate scheduling
strategies/algorithms of computing resources over wide-area networks,
which are often dynamic and unstable in nature.
This paper presents our
preliminary scheduling framework for unifying application and job
scheduling in global computing. The proposed framework establishes a
layer of scheduling and resource allocation subframeworks.
We show our software framework Ninf metaserver which provides low-level
scheduler and resource monitor. 
We also evaluate some scheduling strategies by actual environment and
our performance evaluation model.
