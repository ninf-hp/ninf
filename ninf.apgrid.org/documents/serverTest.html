<h2> Samples </h2>

This package includes very few server test programs.

Firstly, make sure you already set the 'NINF_DIR' variable to point to 
the installed package directory.
Then, go to the '$(NINF_DIR)/serverTest' directory and just type 'make'.

You'll get several programs.
<ul>
<li> _stub_mmul :  matrix multiply
<li> _stub_sin : sin
<li> _stub_cos : cos
</ul>

Now you can start up your Ninf Server.
You can specify the port which will be used by the server
using command line option.
<pre>
> $NINF_DIR/bin/ninf_serv_tcp  -port 3030 sample.config
</pre>
Default port number is 3000. 
<p>
You can check this server using $NINF_DIR/clientTest/test.
<p>

In this directory, we also provide an IDL file for a linpack routines
and lapack routines.
However, we cannot provide the numerical routines themselves because of 
license problems.
If you get the routine by your self, you can use linpack and lapack 
routines via ninf.
<pre>
make linpack
</pre>
