Striking progress of network technology is enabling high-performance global computing, in which computational and data resources in a wide area network (WAN) are transparently employed to solve large-scale problems. Several high-performance global computing systems, such as Ninf, NetSolve, RCS, Legion and Globus have already been proposed.  Each of these systems proposes to effectively achieve high-performance with some efficient scheduling scheme, whereby a scheduler selects a set of appropriate computing resources that solve the client's computational problem. This paper proposes a performance evaluation model for effective scheduling in global computing systems.  The proposed model represents a global computing system by a queueing network, in which servers and networks are represented by queueing systems. Verification of the proposed model and evaluation of scheduling schemes on the model showed that the model could simulate behavior of an actual global computing system and scheduling on the system effectively.
