NetCFD is a Ninf computational component for CFD (Computational Fluid
Dynamics) in a global computing environment.  The netCFD applet GUI
loaded in your Web browser allows a remote user to control and
visualize the CFD computation interactively. Ninf is a Japanese global
computing infrastructure project which involves RWCP, the
Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL), the Tokyo Institute of
Technology, and several collaborators.  Ninf Remote Procedure Call
(RPC) provides an interface to a parallel CFD program running on any
high performance platforms.  The netCFD turns high performance
platforms such as supercomputers and MPPs, clusters into valuable
components for global computing.

Introduction: 
</a>
</h2>
Remarkable growth of computer network technology has resulted a
variety of information services accessible through the Internet.
While most existing global network services such as e-mail, file
archives, and the WWW, are limited to merely sharing data resources,
the global network could be far better utilized, embodying the
potential to provide a computational environment to share
computational resources including CPUs and disk storage. The coming of
gigabit information superhighway will further enhance the vision of
world-wide global computing resources, being able to tap into powers
of enormous numbers of computers with idle computation cycles. For the
global network computing, libraries and systems such as Legion and
NetSolve have been proposed.
<p>
On the other hand, it has become possible to cluster high-performance
commodity workstations and PCs to build cost-effective parallel
computing platforms using high-speed interconnect technologies such as
ATM, Fibre Channel and Myrinet. These interconnects, ``killer
switch'', have performance and scalability of the MPP interconnect and
the flexibility of a local area network.  It is viable to build
parallel systems that are fast, inexpensive, and highly available, by
simply connecting these switches together with the last high
performance commodity components.
<p>
As an infrastructure for world-wide global computing in scientific
computation, we are currently pursuing the Ninf (Network based
Information Library for high performance computing) project.  The goal
of Ninf is to provide a useful interface to a variety of high
performance computing platform such as the clusters for global
scientific computing with computational resources distributed in a
world-wide global network.  The basic Ninf system supports
client-server based computing.  The computational resources are
available as remote libraries at a remote computation host which can
be called through the global network from a programmer's client
program written in existing languages such as Fortran, C, or C++ using
Ninf remote procedure call (RPC).  The programmer can build a global
computing systems by using the Ninf remote libraries as its
components, without being aware of complexities and hassles of network
programming.

The netCFD is a Ninf global computing component for CFD (Computational
Fluid Dynamics) computation, providing interfaces to CFD programs
running on MPP's and clusters, a single Workstation via Ninf RPC.
CFD is one of the most important application areas which requires
high performance computing.
The netCFD applet GUI loaded in a Web browser allows a
remote user to control and visualize the CFD computation
interactively.  The netCFD Ninf component can be used as a part of 
other global computing systems as well.
The netCFD turns high performance platforms
such as supercomputers and MPPs, clusters into valuable components for
global computing.

<a name=interface>
netCFD Ninf Interface:
</a>
</h2>
In the current version of netCFD, the interface is designed for
our CFD program called femFlow, which simulates a give system using
Finite Element Method. 
<p>
The main function in the netCFD is "femFlow" which start to 
execute the CFD program. The following fragment describes the
interface to "femFlow" in the Ninf IDL:
<pre>
Define femFlow(IN int id, IN float header[24],IN int n_node,IN int n_elem,
               IN float x[n_node],IN float y[n_node],IN float z[n_node],
               IN float u[n_node],IN float v[n_node],IN float w[n_node],
               IN float t[n_node],IN float p[n_node],
	       IN char uf[n_node],IN char vf[n_node],IN char wf[n_node],
               IN char tf[n_node],IN char pf[n_node],
               IN short elems[n_elem*8],IN int npe, IN char  pe[n_elem],
               flowDisplay(IN int step[1],IN double ctime[1],
                           IN double delta[1],IN float data[n_node*5]))
</pre>
The IN arguments are sent to the "femFlow" Ninf Stub program through
the Ninf server to call the CFD main program. The last argument is the
call back function in a client side to receive the resulting data
containing the velocity and pressure, temperature of each mesh node at
each simulation time step. 
In netCFD applet GUI, the call backed function is to
visualize the data.
<p>
Other functions are provided to restart the suspended simulation and
replay the last few steps.
Some mesh data files are also stored in the Ninf server, and retrieved 
through the Ninf RPC.

femFlow: a CFD program with FEM
</a>
</h2>
The CFD program used in the netCFD is a parallel 3D CFD program, femFlow,
written in C++ and MPI.
In a parallel environment, the Ninf stub program in the server forks
the parallel process in the parallel platform, and communicates with them.
In a single processor environment, the sequential version is directly
linked to the stub program to execute the program.
<p>
The used modeling and numerical methods are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Basic Equations 
<ul>
<li> Equation of Continuity
<li> Equation of Motion (Navier-Stokes Equation)
<li> Equation of Mechanical Energy
</ul>
<li> Discretization Method 
<ul> 
<li> Finite Element Method (FEM)
<li> 8-nodes isoparametric element
<li> High-order upwind finite element scheme
</ul>
<li> Matrix Solver

<li> SCG (Scaled Conjugate Gradient) Method
</ul>
<li> Time integration
<ul>
<li> SMAC Method

<li> Parallelized

<li> Object-oriented design in C++

<a name=GUI>
netCFD Java applet GUI:
</a>
</h2>
The netCFD applet GUI is an Java applet which allows a
remote user to control and visualize the CFD computation in a web
browser interactively. It uses the Java Ninf RPC interfaces to retrieve
the mesh data and execute the simulation in the Ninf server.
<p>
The simple version just loads the give mesh data file in the HTML file 
and start the simulation.
<p>
The interactive version allows a user to select a mesh data file and
control the simulation.
In the vector mode, the vector at each node indicates the direction of 
flow. The color shows the value of the selected data item including 
velocity and pressure, temperature at each node. In the element mode,
each element is painted using the color of the value at its center.
The mesh mode shows the original mesh data and boundary condition.
<p>
Note that the current version supports only 2D mesh data.
