<hr>
  Rapid increase in speed and availability of global-network is
  opening up the possibilities of globally-distributed supercomputing,
  including our Ninf system. 
  However, performance characteristics of these systems have been
  little investigated, especially under multi-clients, multi-sites
  situations.
<p>
  In order to establish methodology to schedule multiple job requests
  to multiple computational servers effectively and guarantee
  performance per each client, we conducted benchmarks under various
  WAN environments. There, we observed that communication bandwidth dominated
  performance for communication-intensive applications such as
  Linpack, and aggregate bandwidth could be sustained for
  multi-clients located at different internet sites.
<p>
  Based on these observations, we propose the need for a simulation
  model based on queuing theory. And we also performed preliminary
  benchmarks using our scheduling server, called the Ninf Metaserver.
<p>
  We also report on our collaborative efforts in bridging Ninf with
  NetSolve, a similar system being developed at Univ. of Tennessee/ORNL.
