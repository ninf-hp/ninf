<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
Ninflet is a Java-based global computing system that
builds on our experiences with the Ninf system which
facilitated RPC-based computing of numerical tasks in
a wide-area network. The goal of Ninflet is to become
a new generation of concurrent object-oriented system
which harness abundant idle computing powers, and
also seamlessly integrate global as well as local network
parallel computing. Ninflet is designed to make use
of Java features to implement important features in
global computing, such as resource allocation, inter-
Ninflet communication, security, checkpointing, object
migration, and easy server management via HTTP.
