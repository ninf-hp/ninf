In large scale parallel systems, storing memory images with checkpointing will involve massiveamounts of concentrated I/O from many nodes,resulting in considerable execution overhead. Foruser-level checkpointing, overhead reduction usuallyinvolves both spatial, i.e., reducing the amountof checkpoint data, and temporal, i.e., spreadingout I/O by checkpointing data as soon as their valuesbecome fixed. However, for system-level checkpointing,while being generic and effortless for theend-user, most efforts have focused on simple methodsfor spatial reductions only. Instead, we proposespeculative checkpointing, which is an attempt toexploit temporal reduction in system-level checkpointing.We demonstrate that speculative checkpointingcan be implemented as a simple extensionof incremental checkpointing, a well-known checkpointingoptimization algorithm for spatial reduction.Although shown to be useful and effective,the overall effectiveness of speculative checkpointingis greatly affected by the last-write heuristics ofpages, and as such it is difficult to determine thetheoretical upper bound of the effectiveness of speculativecheckpointing in practical applications. Inorder to analyze this, we construct a checkpointing oracle simulator that allows post-mortem analysisof maximal temporal reduction in checkpoint timegiven an application. The benchmarks show thatspeculative checkpointing can reduce up to 32% ofcheckpointing time in NAS parallel benchmarks.
