<div class="section_contents">
Ninf-G Version 5.1.0 (Ninf-G5) is a new version of Ninf-G which is a
reference implementation of the GridRPC API.  
<br>
Major functions of Ninf-G include (1) remote process invocation, (2)
information services, and (3) communication between Ninf-G Client and
Servers.  Ninf-G4 is able to utilize various middleware for remote
process invocation, however Ninf-G4 utilize the Globus Toolkit for
information services and communication between Ninf-G Client and
Servers.
<br>
On the other hand, Ninf-G5 does not assume specific Grid middleware as
prerequisites, that is, unlike the past versions of Ninf-G
(e.g. Ninf-G2, Ninf-G4), Ninf-G5 works in non Globus Toolkit
environments.  Ninf-G5 is able to utilize various middleware not only
for remote process invocation but also for information services and
communication between Ninf-G Client and Servers.  Ninf-G5 is
appropriate for a single system as well as non-Globus Grid environments.
It is expected to provide high performance for task parallel
applications from a single system to Grid.
<br><br>
Here are compatibility issues between Ninf-G5 and Ninf-G4.<br>
The GridRPC API and Ninf-G API implemented by Ninf-G5 is compatible
with Ninf-G4 except the two small issues (details are described in
CHANGES file). 
<br>
Ninf-G Client configuration file for Ninf-G4 is not compatible with Ninf-G5.  
<br>
Due to protocol changes, Ninf-G4 client cannot communicate with
Ninf-G5 executables and vice versa.
