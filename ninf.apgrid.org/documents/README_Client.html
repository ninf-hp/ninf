<h1> Ninf Client Package </h1>

<hr>


<h1> Description </h1>
This package provides
<ul>
<li> libraries for ninf client programs.
<li> include files for Your Makefile.
<li> some test programs.
</ul>

This package supports only 5 architectures.
<ul>
<li> solaris : Solaris 2.2 or later.
<li> sunos:    Solaris 1.1.3 or later
<li> linux:    linux on x86
<li> j90:      Cray super computer J90 or C90
<li> alpha:    OSF for DEC Alpha
</ul>
However, our programs are written in a portable way,
so it will be very easy to port them.

<h1> Ninf Usage </h1>
</center>

<h2> 1. Make Ninf Package  </h2>
First of all, uncompress and untar the package.
The package will give a top directory named "ninfClient".
Go to the directory and type:

<pre>
   >./MAKE ARCHITECTURE_TYPE 
</pre>

ARCHITECTURE_TYPE must be one of the following architectures:
sunos, solaris, j90, linux, alpha.

The MAKE script makes a directory with the architecture name,
and links source files in the directory,
and then executes 'make'.

This script will make two directories, 'lib' and 'include'.
You can install them by typing,
<pre>
    >./MAKE install INSTALL_DIR
</pre>

If you want to make Ninf for different architecture,
first, install Ninf in the other directory,
secondly, clean up this directory by typing,
<pre>
    >./MAKE clean
</pre>
thirdly, make Ninf again for another architecture.


<h2> 2. How to 'Make' Ninf Client Programs </h2>

<h3> 2.1 Set environment variable 'NINF_DIR' </h3>
Set NINF_DIR environment variable to point to the 'ninfClient' directory.
For example, if you untared the package /usr/local 
you should set NINF_DIR to point to /usr/local/ninfClient,
like this.

<pre>
  setenv NINF_DIR /usr/local/ninfClient
</pre>

NOTE: If you installed them to the other directory, 
of course you should specify the directory.

<h3> 2.2 Write your Makefile  </h3>
Write the following line on top of your Makefile.
<pre>
include $(NINF_DIR)/lib/template
</pre>

The 'template' file provides macros 'NINF_CFLAGS' and 'NINF_LDFLAGS'.
These are needed to link Ninf Libraries.

Typical rule for ninf client program  is like this.
<pre>
test: test.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(NINF_CFLAGS) -o test test.c $(LDFLAGS) $(NINF_LDFLAGS)
</pre>

In $(NINF_DIR)/clientTest directory , there are some sample programs which 
can make access our server at ETL, Japan,  directly.
