<h2>Description</h2>
This is a set of two dimensional signal plotters written in Java with
the following properties:
<ul>
<li> Applet or application.
<li> Binary or ASCII data.
<li> Auto-ranging.
<li> Automatic or manual labeling of axes.
<li> Automatic or manual tick marks.
<li> Live, animated plots.
<li> Infinite zooming.
<li> Various plot styles: connected lines, scatter plot, bars, etc.
<li> Various point styles: none, dots, points, and unique marks.
<li> Multiple data sets and a legend.
<li> Color or black and white plotting.
</ul>
The applet implementation
can read data to plot from a URL or construct the data in custom
Java code.  The application can read data from a file and use
command-line arguments to format the plot.  The command-line arguments
are compatible with the popular Unix signal plotter <CODE>xgraph</CODE>.
<p>
There is a set of <a href="demo">demonstrations</a> of these classes.
The main class implementing the plotter is
<a href="Plot.java">Plot</a>.
It is derived from
<a href="PlotBox.java">PlotBox</a>,
which provides only the axes and docorations of the plot.
This is implemented in a base class so that it can be reused for different
kinds of plots.
Live (animated) data plots are supported by the
<a href="PlotLive.java">PlotLive</a> class.
This class is abstract; a derived class must be created to generate
the data to plot (or collect it from some other application).
<p>


The application is implemented by the 
<a href="Pxgraph.java">Pxgraph</a> class.  The <CODE>Pxgraph</CODE> class
includes support for printing and generating HTML for use with the
<CODE>Plot</CODE> applet.

 <P>This code owes a heavy debt to David Harrison, the original author
of <CODE>xgraph</CODE>, which runs under the X window system on Unix
platforms.  An extension to <CODE>xgraph</CODE> called
<CODE>pxgraph</CODE>, written by Joe Buck, reads binary files as well
as ASCII.  For compatibility with these programs, we have provided a
Bourne Shell script called <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> that is a drop-in
replacement for either <CODE>xgraph</CODE> or <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>.
Unlike the original program, however, the Java implementation does not
depend on the X window system.  We have provided a DOS batch file
called <CODE>pxgraph.bat</CODE> that brings <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>
capability to Windows platforms.
