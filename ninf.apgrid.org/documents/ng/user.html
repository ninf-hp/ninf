<h3><a name="idl">Build Ninf-G remote libraries </a> </h3>
The Ninf-G remote libraries are implemented as executable programs
which contain network stub routine as its main routine, and spawned
off by the Gram component on the Ninf-G system. We call such
executable programs <i> Ninf-G executable </i> associated with its
name, and executes the found executable, sets up an appropriate
communication with the client. The stub routine handles the
communication to the Ninf-G system and its client, including argument
marshalling. The underlying executable can be written in any existing
scientific languages such as Fortran, C, etc, as long as it can be
executed in the host. <br>
To register and publish your numerical libraries and computational
resource, you first should provide interface information about those 
numerical libraries and prepares the Ninf-G executable by performing
the following task.

<ul>
  <li> Write a interface information of the numerical libraries you
    wish to register using interface description language called
    Ninf-G IDL. The complete syntax of Ninf-G IDL is described in the 
    Appendix. 

    The following code is a sample Ninf-G IDL for matrix multiplication. <br>
<pre>
Module mmul;

Define dmmul(long mode_in int n, mode_in double A[n][n],
mode_in double B[n][n], mode_out double C[n][n])
&quot;... description ...&quot;
Required &quot;libxxx.o&quot; /* specify library including this routine. */
Calls &quot;C&quot; dmmul(n,A,B,C); /* Use C calling convention. */<br>
</pre>

As such, you should provide the following information in the Ninf-G IDL file. 

<ul>
  <li>Module name. 
  <li>Interface Information(marshaling information) of each library routine. 
  <li>Information to make whole Module. </li>
</ul>
   
  <li>Compile a Ninf-G IDL with Ninf-G generator and generates a stub main
    routine which bridges each numerical librarary and our Ninf-G
    runtime routines, and Makefile to compile the whole program. 
    <pre>% ns_gen &lt;IDL File&gt; </pre>
    
    This will make a Makefile named "module".mak, some
     "_stub_XXX.c" files, XML files, and LDIF files. 

  <li> Make Ninf-G executables by typing 
   <pre> % make -f &lt;module_name&gt;.mak </pre>

   This will make some "_stub_XXX" files 
 

  <li>Copy the LDIF file within the directory ${GLOBUS_DEPLOY_PATH}/etc/gridrpc by
    typing, 
    <pre> make -f &lt;module_name&gt;.mak install </pre>

    The LDIF file looks like the following, 
<pre>     
dn: rpcFuncname=mmul/dmmul, sw=GridRPC
objectclass: GridRPCEntry
hn:
rpcFuncname: mmul/dmmul
module: mmul
entry: dmmul
path: /usr/local/ninf/ninf-g/tests/mmul/_stub_dmmul

<h3>NOTES for dynamic linkage of the Globus shared libraries:<h3><br>
The Globus dynamic linking libraries (shared libraries) must be linked
with the Ninf-G stub executables.  In order to enable this, set the
shared library linkage path appropriately according to the system on
which the Ninf-G stubs are installed.
For example, this is done by adding the location of Globus libraries
(${GLOBUS_LOCATION}/lib) to the environment variable
${LD_LIBRARY_PATH} of the Globus Gatekeeper spawning via inetd, or on
Linux, add (${GLOBUS_LOCATION}/lib) in /etc/ld.so.conf.
</strong>
</ul>

<h3><a name="interface"> Programming Interface </a> </h3>

Before starting, be sure that the environment variables
<i>GLOBUS_LOCATION</i> (for GT2) or <i>GLOBUS_INSTALL_PATH</i> (for Globus Ver.1), and <i>NS_DIR</i>  are defined appropriately.

Since the original Ninf client programming interface was designed to be as
language independent as possible, we have developed a variety of
programming interfaces such as C, Fortran, Java, and Lisp. The concept
of the Ninf-G system is the same. Currently the Ninf-G system supports
the C interface, and we are in the process of building the Java
interface and other language bindings. Ninf-G provides both Grid RPC native API (GRPC API) and Ninf
compatible API (Ninf API).  Ninf API is a full-compatible API with
Ninf version 1 which provides simple and easy programming interface to
programmers.  GRPC API provides lower level and flexible programming
interface to programmers.  According to the requirements, application
programmers can build Grid-enabled applications using either GRPC API
or Ninf API.  In this section, we introduce you several representative
functions using C interface for both <a href="#grpcapi">GRPC API</a> 
and <a href="#ninfapi">Ninf API</a>. The complete API reference is described in the Appendix. 

<h3> <font color="red"><a name="grpcapi">Grid RPC API</a></font> </h3>

<h3> Initialize </h3>

This function read configuration file for your client program and
set system parameters for Ninf-G.
<pre>
main (int argc, char **argv) {
   char *conf_file = argv[1];

   grpc_initialize(conf_file);
   ...
</pre>

<h3> Synchronous Call </h3>

The synchronous call to Ninf-G from C is the easiest to
implement, just call the function, <i> grpc_call() </i> .

This function returns an error code. It takes as arguments the name
of a problem and the list of input data and output data. These inputs
are listed according to the calling sequence defined in the
corresponding Ninf IDL. The more detailed information on the Ninf-G IDL
are described in the section called <a href="admin.html#idl"> Ninf-G IDL
</a>

The C prototype of the function is 

<pre>
grpc_call(grpc_function_handle_t *handle, &lt;argument list&gt;)
</pre> 

where *handle is a pointer to the handle to the numerical library on
the Ninf-G system. Let us resume our example of the call to a simple 
matrix multiplication. In C, the local function to this caliculation
looks like 
<pre>
 mmul(double *A, double *B, double *C), 
</pre>

Meanwhile, the equivalent synchronous call to Ninf-G in C is 

<pre>
grpc_function_handle_t *handle;
grpc_function_handle_init(&handle, "ninf.apgrid.org", 
                          3030, "lib/mmul");
status = grpc_call(&handle, A, B, C);
</pre>

As such, you should initialize a function handle to the Ninf-G remote
library using <i> grpc_function_handle_init </i> which takes as
arguments a server name, port number, and a module name of the
library. 

<h3> Asynchronous Call </h3>

The standard grpc_call() RPC is synchronous in that the client waits
until the completion of the computation on the server side. For
task-parallel execution, Ninf-G facilitates several asynchronous call
APIs. For example, the most basic asynchronous call  
<pre> 
int grpc_async_call(grpc_function_handle_t *handle, 
                    &lt;argument list&gt;)
</pre> 

It is almost identical to <i> grpc_call </i> except that it returns immediately after
all the arguments have been sent. The return value is the session ID
of the asynchronous call; the ID is used for various synchronizations
such as waiting for the return value of the call.
<br>
There are several calls for synchronization. The most basic is the
<pre>
grpc_wait(int sessionID); 
grpc_wait_all();
</pre>, 
<i> grpc_wait() </i> is the function with which
 we wait for the result of the asynchronous
call with the supplied session ID. <i> grpc_wait_all() </i> waits for all
preceding asynchronous invocations made. 


<!--
Here, we employ
grpc_wait_all() to parallelize the above PI client so that it uses
multiple simultaneous remote server calls:
The following example shown below is the program which distributes the parallel
tasks to multiple servers. 
We specify the number of server hosts and their names in lines 1 and
2-5, respectively. Line 6 is the port number used, and line 12 divides
the number of Monte Carlo trials with the number of servers,
determining the number of trials per server. The for loop in lines
14-21 invokes the servers asynchronously: Line 16 generates the URI of
the server, line 17 calls the server asynchronously, and line 22 waits
for all the servers to finish. Line 23 aggregates the results returned
from all the servers.  In this manner, we can easily write a parallel
parameter sweep survey program using the task parallel primitives of
GridRPC. We next modify the program to perform dynamic load balancing
-->


<h3><a name="client"> Running the Ninf-G Client </a> </h3>

After developing the Ninf Client Application by the use of the
programming interface, what you need to do for running the application
are listed here. 


<ul>
<li> <h4> Compile your Ninf-G client application using <i> ns_client_gen </i></h4> 
<pre>
${NG_DIR}/bin/ns_client_gen -g -o test_client test_client.c 
</pre>

<li> <h4> Write a configuration file as the following. </h4> <br>
<pre> 
#
#       Ninf-G Client Config File
#

port    = 24001                        # specify the port number
serverhost      = brain.a02.aist.go.jp # Globus node 
ldaphost        = brain.a02.aist.go.jp # LDAP Host
ldapport        = 2135                 # LDAP Port number
</pre>

<li> <h4> Obtain a Globus proxy </h4>


Before submitting any jobs to the Ninf-G system, you need to run the 
following command and get a proxy certificate, which allows you to
utilize any Ninf-G numerical libraries on the Globus resource without
reentering your pass phrase while your proxy is active. 
We assume you have already obtained a Globus Certificate
from the Globus Certificate Authority and you are in the resources'
grid mapfiles. 

<pre> 
% grid-proxy-init 
</pre>

You can set the time for the proxy to be in effect; use 
<pre>
% grid-proxy-init -hours (nhours) 
</pre> 

If you wish to determine your proxy status, use <i> grid-proxy-info
-all </i> to display the contents or test the status of your proyx. 


<li> <h4> Run the Ninf-G client </h4>
<pre>
% ./test_client config.cl
</pre>

</ul>


<h3><a name="manage"> Managing Jobs </a> </h3>

Since the Ninf-G system is built on top of the Globus, you can
directly take advantage of the Globus commands for
managing the submitted jobs such as checking, killing, and cleaning. 

We give you very quick overview of the Globus commands, and more
detailed explanation can be seen in the Globus manual. 

<h3> Checking my job </h3>

<pre>
% globus-job-run &lt;hostname&gt; /bin/ps -u &lt;username&gt;
</pre>

When you submit a job to the batch scheduler, enter <i>
globus-job-status </i> followed by the job contact string URL. 

<pre>
% globus-job-submit $lt;hostname$gt; $lt;command$gt;
https://$lt;hostname$gt;:3031/342265377/
% globus-job-status https://ninf.apgrid.org:3031/942265377/
</pre>

The different status are PENDING(waiting in the queue),
ACTIVE(running), SUSPENDED, DONE, and FAILED. 

<h3> Canceling/Cleaning a Job </h3> 

If you interrupt the <i> globusrun </i> or <i> globus-job-run </i>
process(by entering CTRL-C or sending it a SIGINT), your jobs should
automatically be canceld. 


<h3> <font color="red"><a name="ninfapi">Ninf API</a></font> </h3>

<h3> Initialize </h3>

This function parse argument list for your client program and retrieve
arguments for Ninf-G system.  This function returns new argc value.
Here is an example showing typical usage.
<pre>
main (int argc, char ** argv){
	argc = Ninf_parse_arg(argc, argv);
	...
</pre>

<h3> Synchronous call </h3>
This function calls Ninf function on a remote server.
The first argument specifies server and function.

Here is an example that calls "mmul" function.
<pre>
     Ninf_call("mmul", n, A, B, C);
</pre>

You can omit the server name and port.
In such case, a default server will be used.
Default server can be specified by environment variable "NINF_SERVER"
and "NINF_SERVER_PORT", or Ninf_parse_arg.

This function returns 0 if succeed, returns -1 if failed.

<h3> Asynchronous Call </h3>
This function is almost same as Ninf_call, but it returns immediately.
Using this function, you can invoke several sessions simultaneously.

It returns non-negative ID if succeed, returns -1 if failed.

<pre>
     id = Ninf_call_async("mmul", n, A, B, C);
</pre>

There are several calls for synchronization. The most basic is the
<pre>
Ninf_wait(int sessionID); 
Ninf_wait_all();
</pre>, 
<i> Ninf_wait() </i> is the function with which
 we wait for the result of the asynchronous
call with the supplied session ID. <i> grpc_wait_all() </i> waits for all
preceding asynchronous invocations made. 

<p> As mentioned above, <tt> Ninf_call() </tt> is the client interface to 
  the Ninf compute and database servers.  In order to illustrate the programming 
  interface with an example, let us consider a simple matrix multiply routine 
  in C programs with the following interface: </p>
<PRE>
double A[N][N],B[N][N],C[N][N];   /* declaration */
....
dmmul(N,A,B,C);	                  /* calls matrix multiply, C = A * B */
</PRE>
When the <tt> dmmul </tt> routine is available on a Ninf server,
the client program can call the remote library using  <tt> Ninf_call </tt>, 
in the following manner:
<PRE>
Ninf_call(&quot;dmmul&quot;,N,A,B,C); /* call remote Ninf library on server */
</PRE>
Here, <tt> dmmul </tt> is the name of library registered as a Ninf
executable on a server, and <tt> N,A,B,C </tt> are the same arguments.
As we see here, the client user only needs to specify the name
of the function as if he were making a local function call;
<tt> Ninf_call() </tt> automatically determines the function arity and 
the type of each argument, appropriately marshals the arguments, makes
the remote call to the server, obtains the results, places the
results in the appropriate argument, and returns to the client.
In this way, the Ninf RPC is designed to give the users an
illusion that arguments are shared between the client and the server.

<P>
The reader may also notice that the physical location of the Ninf server
is not specified in the example. Ninf provides a variety of ways for
the client to specify the server and its registered library: 
<UL>
<LI> Specify server with an environment variable.
<LI> Directly specify server and library with an URL of the Ninf executable.
</UL>
<P>
To realize such simplicity in the client programming interface,
we designed Ninf RPC so that client function call obtains all the 
interface information regarding the called library function at runtime
from the server. Although this will cost an extra network round trip
time, we judged that typical scientific applications are both
compute and data intensive such that the overhead should be small
enough. The interface information includes:
<UL>
<LI> the number of parameters.
<LI> argument types.
<LI> access mode of arguments (read or write).
<LI> size of arguments.
<LI> argument marshaling information.
<LI> how to send and receive data from/to the Ninf server.
</UL>
The client function call requests the interface
information of the calling function to the Ninf server, which in turn
returns the registered Ninf executable interface information to the client. 
The client library then interprets and marshals the arguments on the
stack according to the supplied information. For variable-sized array
arguments, the IDL must specify an expression that includes the input
scalar arguments whereby the size of the arrays can be computed.
This design is in contrast to traditional RPCs, where stub generation
is done on the client side at compile time. As a result of dynamic
interface acquisition, Ninf RPC does not require such compile-time
activities at all, relieving the users from any code maintenance.
<A HREF=#ninfnakada95>[2]</A> describes the structure of the 
interface information and the protocol in detail.

<P>
In the above example, the client function call sends the input arrays,
<tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>,
whose size is computed by the parameter <tt> N </tt>.
The Ninf server invokes the Ninf executable of <tt> dmmul </tt> library,
and forwards the input data to it.
When the computation is done, the result is sent back to the client 
through the server. The client function call stores the returned data at
the location pointed by the argument, C.

<P> The Ninf RPC may also be invoked asynchronously to exploit network-wide parallelism. 
  It is possible to issue the request to a Ninf server, continue with the other 
  computation, and poll for the request later. Multiple RPC requests to different 
  servers are also possible. For this reason, the asynchronous Ninf PRC is an 
  important feature for parallel programming.
