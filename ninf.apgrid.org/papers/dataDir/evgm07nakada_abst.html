<h1> Abstract </h1>
<hr>
  To fully utilize resources in computer center, virtualization techniques are getting popular and several systems are proposed for this purpose. However, they just provide set of virtualized nodes, not the 'virtual clusters'; i.e., they are not able to install and configure middlewares and tools that makes 'set of nodes' into 'cluster'. Another problem is that they just virtualize nodes, leaving storage resources and networks, which are equivalently essential for clusters, un-virtualized. We propose a virtual cluster management system which virtualizes compute resources, as well as disk storage and network, and install and setup softwares that are essential for cluster operation, using Rocks, a cluster provisioning system. We virtualize storage with iSCSI and network with tagged VLAN.
