<h1>Abstract</h1>
Ninf and NetSolve are remote computing systems 
which are oriented to provide numerical computations.
These two systems are very similar to each other 
in there design and motivation.
In this memo, we compare these two systems and
discuss on advantages and disadvantages.
We made adapters to enable each system to 
use numerical routines installed on the other system.
We will show the design and implementation of the adapters.

<h1>1. Ninf and NetSolve</h1>
<a href="http://ninf.apgrid.org/">Ninf</a> is a remote computing system we are developing.
It provides remote numerical computation service for client programs,
in almost transparent manner.
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~casanova/NetSolve/">NetSolve</a> is a remote computing system
developed by Jack Dongarra and his colleagues 
in University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
<p>
These two systems are developed under the same motivation,
and there system configuration are very similar.
Sharing there numerical routines benefits there users.
To enable the sharing, some adapters required to
translate protocols and data.

<h2>1.1 Ninf Overview </h2>
Figure 1 shows a configuration of typical Ninf system.
There are NinfServers which provide numerical computation routines, 
and clients which request computation, and MetaServer.
The subsystem called ``MetaServer'' take  responsibility on
load distribution.
MetaServer is a kind of proxy server, 
so clients do not have to know which is MetaServer
and which is NinfServer.
A client issues request to a MetaServer, and
MetaServer choose a proper NinfServer and forwards the request.

                            |             
  NinfClient -- MetaServer -+-- NinfServer
                            |             
                            +-- NinfServer
</pre>

<h2>1.2 NetSolve Overview </h2>
Figure \ref{fig:netsolve-overview} shows configuration of typical NetSolve System.
The subsystem called ``Agent'' take responsibility on load distribution.
The Agent is just a ``broker'' and it gives possible server list 
to the clients.
Clients choose a proper server and connect it directly.

  NetSolveClient  <-----------> Agent  
            |                          
            +--------- NetSolveServer  
             +--------- NetSolveServer 
              +--------- NetSolveServer
</pre>

<h2>1.3 Comparison between Ninf and NetSolve </h2>
The following list is summary of the comparison between 
Ninf and NetSolve.

<ul>
<li><p> MetaServer and Agent <br>
	Both MetaServer and Agent play the same roll in each system,
	load distribution, but they are implemented differently.
	MetaServer is a proxy server, but Agent is a broker.
</p>

<li> <p>Interface Information Structure <br>
	Both systems send interface information dynamically.
	Structures of the informations are very different each other.
</p>
<p>
	Ninf interface structure is designed based on C language calling 
	sequence. 
</p>
<p>
	NetSolve structure is more abstract.
	It defines language independent I/O information.
	Language dependent calling sequence is provided as a addendum.
</p>
<p>
	Their representation abilities are also different.
	NetSolve just allows, scalar, vector, 2-dimensional-array.
	Ninf allows up-to 10-dimensional-array.
	Also, stride for the array can be specified in Ninf.
	On the other hand, Ninf does not support 'complex' data-type,
	which is supported by NetSolve.
</p>
<li> <p> Data Transfer <br>
	In Ninf, the size of data must be determined in advance 
	of the transmission.
	Therefore, data itself does not have the information
	about its size.
</p>
<p>
	In NetSolve, each data is attached with the size information.
	It enables to adopt more dynamic protocol.
</p>

<li> <p> Callback and UPF <br>
	Ninf provides 'callback' facility.
	You can specify a client-side function to be called from the 
	server-side routine.
	This can be used to display intermediate results,
	and/or load-distribution.
</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, NetSolve provides UPF(user provided function).
	The specified function is transferred to the server as a source code,
	and compiled and linked with the server-side routine.
</p>
</ul>


<h1> 2. Adapters </h1>
To use routines on each other system, some protocol translation
adapter is required.
<p>
We designed and implemented two adapters:
one enables Ninf clients to call NetSolve routines,
the other enables NetSolve clients to call Ninf routines.

<h2> 2.1 Ninf - NetSolve adapter </h2>
This adapter acts as a NinfServer in the Ninf system, 
and behaves as a client in the NetSolve system.
Figure \ref{fig:netsolve-adapter} shows the configuration of 
the entire system.
<p>

<center><pre>
                            +-- [BRIGDE] <----> NetSolveAgent
                            |       +-- NetSolveServer       
                            |        +-- NetSolveServer      
  NinfClient -- MetaServer -+                                
                            +-- NinfServer                   
                            |                                
                            +-- NinfServer                   
</pre>

The adapter is written in Java.
The roll of the adapter is as follows.

<ul>
<li> Protocol translation
<li> Interface information translation<br>
	Translate NetSolve interface information structure,
	Ninf interface information.
<li> Data transfer<br>
	It caches entire date once, and forwards it.
</ul>


<h2> 2.1 NetSolve - Ninf Adapter </h2>
This adapter enables NetSolve clients to call numerical 
routines installed on Ninf system.
This adapter behaves as an NetSolve server:
connects to a NetSolve Agent and introduces itself, 
and receives request from client.
In the Ninf world, it is a kind of MetaServer:
it manages plural NinfServers, and dispatch 
received request to the proper server.
<p>
Figure \ref{fig:ninf-adapter} shows the configuration 
of a system with this adapter.
<p>

<center>
<pre>
  NetSolveClient  <-----------> Agent           
            |                                   
            +--------- NetSolveServer           
             \                                  
              +--------- [Bridge] -+- NinfServer
                                   +- NinfServer
                                   +- NinfServer
</pre>
Figure 4: NetSolve-Ninf Adapter</center>

<p>
This adapter is written in java.
It reads a configuration file which specifies NinfServers and
NetSolve Adapter.

<pre>
    server ninf.apgrid.org:3030
    server etlsolon.etl.go.jp:3030

    agent  comet.cs.utk.edu
</pre>
<p>
First, the adapter connects to the specified NinfServers
and retrieves routine interface informations.
and translates the informations into NetSolve form 
and store them.
<p>
Then, the adapter connects to the specified Agent and introduce 
itself and routines.
<p>
Finally, it wait for client requests at port No.2222 
(the NetSolve server port).
<p>
When request arrives, the adapter receives 
parameters and forward them to a proper NinfServer.
The adapter has same load-distribution ability as the MetaServer.


<h2> 2.2 Preliminary Evaluation </h2>
We tested Ninf-NetSolve adapter to evaluate the overhead.
<p>
We compared NetSolve native client and 
Ninf client with the Adapter.
We used NetSolve Agent on 'comet.cs.utk.edu',
and NetSolve server on 'dancer.cs.utk.edu'
(It's impossible to specify computation server.
But fortunately, our experimental computations were
always done on the server).
<p>
For the evaluation, we used 'degsv'(a part of LAPACK) routine.
The size of matrix were 50, 100, 150, 200.
We measured 10 times each, and took the shortest one.
<p>

<table border=4 align="center">
<tr><td> Execution Time [sec]	</td><td> 50 </td><td> 100 </td><td> 150 </td><td> 200 </td></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td>NetSolve native client   </td><td>  8.2 </td><td> 18.4 </td><td> 33.3 </td><td> 72.1 </td></tr>
<tr><td>Ninf client with adapter </td><td>  8.5 </td><td> 21.7 </td><td> 38.8 </td><td> 82.4 </td></tr>
<tr></tr>
<tr><td>Overhead</td>	 <td> 0.3 </td><td> 3.3 </td><td> 5.5 </td><td> 10.3 </td></tr>
</table>

We can see that overhead time depends on the size of 
the transferred data.
The adapter stores all data once, then send to the server.
This cacheing is considered to be the cause of the overhead.

<h1> 3.Discussion </h1>
As mentioned before, there is some non-trivial difference between
Ninf and NetSolve.
Therefore, some numerical routines cannot be shared by the two systems.
<p>

Some of the differences come from their design concept,
and are essential, 
but some of them are just the implement issues.
The two system can share some layers in their implements.
<p>

We should specify data transfer layer
which is specialized for numerical computation,
on top of simple data transfer layers, such as XDR.
It will enable efficient adapter implementation.
<p>

We should also provide non-binary data transfer facility for the layer.
For example, sparse matrices are ordinary represented 
in some text format.
<p>

Data format (XDR or native representation) should be negotiated 
in advance of the data transfer itself.
The negotiation process should be implemented into the layer.
